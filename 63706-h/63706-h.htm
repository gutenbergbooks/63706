<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Disappearance.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> is nothing so dreadful as the heart’s first
disappointment. To love vainly—oh! what is
more agonising. We feel as if every one had
turned against us; as if there was nothing left to
live for in this world; as if the springs of life, and
the joy of existence had departed forever from us.
The loss of a friend may be compensated for, and
the ruin of our fortunes can be borne without
despair; but the hopelessness of a first love can
never be ameliorated by aught on earth. Go where
we will, the blight of the heart will continue with
us. <span class='it'>We can never forget.</span> Hope will have dried
up within us. We feel, like a stranger in a strange
land, as an outcast on the world, beholding feelings
in which we can take no part around us, and reminded
daily of our misery by the happiness of
others. Alas! for the one disappointed in a first love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Isabel saw no more of her cousin.
But when the whole of the next day passed, and
she still did not meet him, she began to be alarmed.
She feared to ask for him. Her father had been
absent all day, and it was not until night that he
returned. When he did, he brought the intelligence,
that, in compliance with an old promise, he had
that morning visited the earl of ——, an influential
courtier of the neighboring county, in order to procure
for Lorraine a commission. The page had,
the preceding evening, begged to be allowed to join
the army so eagerly, that having nothing particularly
to do, and noticing and applauding his young
cousin’s anxiety to assume arms, he had ridden
over with him to —— castle, and after obtaining
the appointment for him, had left him there, at his
urgent request, with his new colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I rejoice too at his determination,” continued
Lord Deraine, “although it was somewhat
of a sudden. I began almost to think that the lad
was growing too effeminate, with his lute, and other
lady pastimes, and forgetting the name that he bore.
But I ween had you beheld his eye glisten to-day,
when he was first addressed by his military title,
you would have said that he was every inch a Lorraine.
And God forfend that it should ever come
to disgrace! My mother was a daughter of that
house,” continued the aged nobleman, “and I feel a
strange interest in the boy’s success. Had you seen
him to-day you would have said he was a true
descendant of the iron-hearted warrior who led that
charge at Agincourt, which decided the fortune of
the day. Were I as I once was, I would e’en go
one campaign with him to learn how they fight in
these degenerate days, and show them the manner
in which we cavaliers of Prince Rupert used to
charge the canting round-heads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But pa,” said Isabel, scarcely venturing to
speak, “did he leave no word—no message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I had almost forgot. He sent a note to
you—here it is—about some hawk, or lute, or his
greyhound perhaps—did he bid you farewell, by
the bye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel felt her heart beat faster at the enquiry of
her parent, but giving an evasive answer to his
question, she took the note, and left the apartment.
Little did Lord Deraine suspect the agony which
had driven his young kinsman from his halls, or
dream of the tears that Isabel shed that night over
her ill-fated cousin’s epistle. It ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Dearest Isabel:—I know not whether to write to
you; and yet why should I not? Are we not cousins—brought
up under the same roof—taught to love
each other from childhood—bound to one another by
a thousand ties? Yet we cannot meet again as we
have met! Oh! little did I think twenty-four hours
ago that such agony as I now suffer would so soon be
my lot. But I will not blame you. You never said
you loved me—you never smiled on me except as a
cousin. It is only I who am wrong. Could I ever
think that you, the pure, the beautiful, the courted,
would look on a poor page with love? Yet I did: I
nursed the delusion long: and now—oh! God—the
dream is forever broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forgive me, dear Isabel—for I will yet once more
call you by that name—forgive me, for I scarce know
what I write. I leave you for years, perhaps forever.
I go to seek a name of which you will not be ashamed,
or to die. God bless you, again and again, and again
dearest Isabel! May you be happy. Once more God
bless you!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The tears of the maiden fell thick and fast as she
perused this passionate epistle, and she sighed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, poor Lorraine—would we had never
met, or that you had never loved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The absence of the page was felt throughout the
castle, for all had loved the generous and high-souled
boy. For many a long day the old servitors
loved to recall his boyish deeds, and augur a glorious
career for the young soldier. And often, as Isabel
sat in her splendid chamber, while twilight deepened
through the gorgeously curtained windows, her
thoughts would wander away after her absent
cousin, and taking the melancholy hue of the hour,
she would indulge in mournful memories of the
past, and sigh that she could make no return to
Lorraine except what was all too cold for him,—her
friendship. Even De Courtenay, could he have read
her thoughts at such moments, would have pardoned
her that involuntary pang.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter V.</span></h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Young Soldier.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the eve of a battle. Far along the sides
of the hill stretched the camp of the allies, the long
lines of white tents gleaming in the starlight, and
the death-like silence of the sleeping army filling
the mind with an awe, second only to that inspired
by the holy silence of the calm and peaceful stars
above. Below was a wide extensive valley, through
which wound a narrow river, while here and there
along the plain were scattered rich farms, and
solemn woodlands. On the opposite range of uplands,
the camp of the enemy might be detected by
the long-line of watch-fires glittering on the horizon.
Occasionally the neigh of a steed, or the “all’s
well!” of the sentinel, floated past on the night air.
All else was still. A profound calm reigned where
to-morrow would be heard the shouts of thousands,
the booming of artillery, and the clash of meeting
squadrons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was yet long before day when Lorraine sprang
from his couch, and hastily attiring himself, prepared
to join his troop, at the expected summons.
It was to him a day of the most intense interest,
for not only was he then for the first time to behold
the conflict of man with man, but he was to begin
that career of arms which he had determined should
give him renown or death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” he exclaimed energetically, “though
Isabel may never love me, she shall hear my name
in every mouth, or else be told by some pitying
tongue that I have died in the heart of battle. I
feel that within me which will make or mar me.
To-day shall lay the first stone in my advancement,
and men will talk no longer of the idle page, when
they hear of the deeds of the warrior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such emotions stirring in his bosom, Lorraine
joined his corps on the morning of that eventful
day; nor did he, for a moment, through the long
hours of that celebrated battle, forget his vow.
Wherever the danger was the most imminent, there
the gallant young soldier was to be found. When
the battle was at its fiercest, Lorraine seemed only
more calm and collected; until even hoary veterans
were astonished at the fearless composure of the
young officer. Already had he performed deeds of
daring, which had been alone enough to make him
the wonder of his corps, when he was ordered to
charge, with his body of dragoons, on a battalion of
the enemy who were about making a movement on
the left of the allies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flushed with the confidence thus displayed in his
coolness and valor, Lorraine dashed off to take
up his position so as to be able to check the enemy’s
advance at the most favorable moment. Rapid as
was his movement, however, he had been anticipated
by the foe, and before he could reach the
threatened position, the detachment of infantry defending
the farm-house had been driven in, half
their number made prisoners, and the rest compelled
to fall back in disorder. When Lorraine approached
their post, they were retreating up the hill immediately
in the rear of the farm-house, while a strong
body of the enemy’s infantry was pressing upon
them in the rear. A thick wood, running at right
angles with the road taken by the retreating corps,
effectually hid Lorraine’s dragoons from sight, until
the very moment when the enemy’s flank was
exposed to his charge. Perceiving his advantage,
the young soldier waved his sword, and turning to
his troops, shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charge!” and in an instant, like a whirl-wind
they burst upon the astonished enemy. The shock
was irresistible. Taken completely by surprise,
and already disordered by the pursuit, the foe scarcely
stood their ground a moment, but broke in all
directions. A scene of wild consternation ensued.
Through and through the tumultuous crowd of fugitives,
dashed the troopers of Lorraine, hewing and
treading down their antagonists at every step.
Amid this wild uproar, the young officer might be
detected by his snowy plume and white charger;
and wherever they were seen, there the battle was
sure to rage the thickest. But though broken in
nearly every direction, there was still a fragment of
the enemy’s corps, which, rallying around its
leader, endeavored for a while to maintain its
ground, and even succeeded in repelling the attack
made upon it by a portion of the late fugitives,
who, rallying at the first appearance of succor, under
charge of their commander, attempted to cut off
the retreat of the enemy. At this moment Lorraine
perceived their peril. Quick as lightning he dashed
to their aid, followed by a portion of his gallant
band; and arrived at the very moment when his
brother officer, having been struck from his horse,
lay at the mercy of the enemy’s uplifted sword. It
was but the work of a moment to strike up the
weapon of the assailant, and with another blow to
sever the arm of the French officer. Lorraine’s
troopers at the same instant, rushing like a thunder-bolt
upon the enemy, scattered them down the hill,
and before the young officer could stoop to raise his
fellow soldier, the enemy had vanished from around
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom am I indebted for this timely aid?”
said the wounded man, endeavoring to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To a friend—Henry De Lorraine. As I have
just joined the army even my brother officers are
unknown to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will not be long unknown to them,
for a more gallant charge I never saw made, and
even a De Courtenay may consider it an honor to
be the friend of a Lorraine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young officer felt his heart beat as it had
not beat yet through all that day’s conflict. The
lover of his cousin was before him. With that
name rushed a thousand memories upon his mind,
and for an instant he stood silent and spell-bound
before De Courtenay. But recalling, with an effort,
his wandering thoughts, he bowed to the speaker’s
compliment, and assisting the wounded officer from
the field, recalled his troops, and prepared to maintain
the position he had so gallantly recovered.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI.</span></h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Fame: The new friend.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole camp was ringing with the deeds
of Lorraine. The days of Roland were revived.
Old and young, officers and soldiery conversed only
of the youthful hero who had already won for himself
the title of “the bravest of the brave.” Not
only in his first battle, but in every successive engagement,
Lorraine had achieved wonders. He
had already been promoted through several grades;
general officers and titled princes courted his society;
and, as if by an enchanter’s wand, in less
than a year from the opening of his career as a
soldier, the name of the unknown page was ringing
in every capital of Europe. Oh! how delicious
was it for him to know that Isabel heard of his
deeds, and that though she might not love, she
could not pity him. No, he had saved himself
from that. His vow had been fulfilled. He had
become renowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange friendship had sprung up between
Lorraine and him whom he had rescued. The
grateful De Courtenay had sought the intimacy of
his preserver in such a way as could not be refused,
and though it was, at first, agony for Lorraine to
be the confidant of his rival, yet he could not avoid
it without insulting his new friend, or exposing
his own hopeless love. But the former course he
scorned: and to the latter alternative he could not
listen. He was forced, therefore, to endure in silence
that, which, like the vulture of Prometheus,
was eating out his vitals. Daily did De Courtenay
pour into his ear his tale of love, thinking that as
the relative of Isabel, Lorraine would sympathise
with his long continued separation, and join in the
praises of his mistress; but little did the generous
young nobleman know of the agony he was thus
inflicting upon his new friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the war continued. Siege after siege,
and battle after battle marked the conquering career
of the allies, and in every brilliant action the deeds
of the young hero shone forth with unabated lustre.
In the hottest of the conflict, heading the assault or
leading a charge, Lorraine was ever to be found,
seeming to bear a charmed life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the cheek of the young hero grew thinner
daily, and amid all his splendid and rapidly increasing
renown, it was plain that his unquiet spirit was
tossing to and fro within him, and wearing out his
very existence. His brow grew darker as if with
long years of care; his eye burned with a deep,
restless, almost wild brilliancy; and his port became
prouder and prouder, for he grew more lofty as
the struggle with himself became fiercer. Yes!
the contest was still waged against his unhappy
love,—how hopelessly, let others in the same situation
tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His was not the love of days, or weeks, or
months, but of years: his was not an evanescent
feeling of admiration, but the deep, fathomless
passion of one whose whole soul was consumed by
his love. How could he conquer such an emotion?
No, he might fly from Isabel, but could he fly from
himself? His love had become a part of his being:
it was his sustenance, his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after a hard contested battle, in which
his corps had distinguished itself unusually, and he
had turned the tide of war on one wing by his own
valor and influence, that his sovereign filled up the
measure of his renown, by reviving in his person,
an honor long disused, and creating him a knight
banneret upon the field of conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise, Sir Henry Lorraine,” said the monarch,
as, surrounded by a brilliant cortège, he waved his
hand for the kneeling knight to arise, “you have
this day won a name far more imperishable than
the title I have bestowed upon you. Were a tithe
of the gentlemen of my realm like you, England
would have a Bayard or a Roland for every
knight’s fee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a compliment, from the lips of a phlegmatic
sovereign, placed the finishing stone on the renown
of Lorraine. He was henceforth without a rival.
Courted by the titled; adored by his fellow soldiers;
and smiled on by the young and beautiful; what
farther had this world to bestow upon him? Alas!
all these brought him no happiness. To Lorraine
they were but empty shadows, for they could not
give him the love of his cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! how will Isabel rejoice to hear of this,”
said De Courtenay, the day after the young hero’s
knighthood, “you and she were playmates in childhood,
you know, and it will please her all the more
that I too love you. I wonder why she says
nothing of you in her letters, but then—.” De
Courtenay paused. Even the happy lover felt that
it would not do to say how wholly a mistress forgets
in her missives all but the object of her
adoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lorraine could not reply. His brow throbbed to
bursting, and he turned away. Yet he did not
betray himself. Never had De Courtenay suspected
that his friend loved Isabel; and Lorraine vowed
in his inmost heart that he never should.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus time rolled on, and day by day, and
week by week, and month by month, the renown
of the young soldier increased, while the blight at
his heart grew more venomous and deadly. <span class='it'>He
loved in vain.</span> Often in the still watches of the
night, when the camp lay buried in silence around
him, and the holy stars looked down like guardian
angels on the world below, he would stand for
hours, gazing on the hushed landscape around, and
wandering, in thought, back to the time when he
stood at the side of Isabel, and together they gazed
up upon the starry sky, or listened to the low
whisper of the night-wind across the firmament,
while their hearts held high communion, as if
linked in with each other by some mysterious sympathy.
Alas! those days were gone forever. Alone
Lorraine gazed up at the sky, while Isabel perhaps
thought of him no more.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII.</span></h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>He Comes.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cousin, young Harry, now Sir Henry
Lorraine, knight banneret, is coming to visit us,
Isabel,” said Lord Deraine, one morning, as he
entered the breakfast room, holding an open letter
in his hand, “he has come over with despatches,
and says that he shall have a few days of leisure.
Here is his letter. It came by a special courier, to
whom I gave a reply, inviting Lorraine down here
at once. So you may expect the gallant boy to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But pa, how know you he will come?” said
Isabel, with ill-concealed agitation, for she had not
yet forgotten their last parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come! why where else would he go, but to
those who love him like we do? Ah! I wonder if
glory has changed him. By the honor of my house
but it will make me young again to see the gallant
lad, who has made the name of a Lorraine to ring
like a watch word through Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel knew not scarcely how she felt. She
dreaded, and yet wished to meet her cousin. Long
did she think over it that night, and wonder if he
had conquered his ill-fated passion. And when at
length she fell asleep, it was after many a prayerful
hope that Lorraine might have learned to
look upon her only as a cousin, and have sought
among fairer and loftier ones, to whom he might
fearlessly aspire, a being more worthy of his fortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why had Lorraine, after tearing himself away
from Isabel, determined to re-visit her? Alas! who
can tell the workings of that master passion <span style='font-size:smaller'>LOVE</span>?
How often do we resolve to see the face of some
dear one no more, and how often do we return
again and again to her presence, hoping even
against hope, until we feel that the cup of bliss is too
surely dashed from our lips forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a glorious afternoon when he arrived at
the gates of the park, and at every step seeing
something to remind him of the past, he gradually
fell into a reverie, from which he was only aroused
by coming in front of the hall, and finding himself
welcomed by the noisy tenantry, as well as by a
score of old familiar faces in the shape of trusty
servitors. Their homely but joyous greetings went
to Lorraine’s heart, and almost drew tears from his
eyes, when he reflected how differently he had
passed that threshold the last time. His uncle met
him at the hall door, and falling into his arms,
blessed him: while Isabel frankly extending her
hand, greeted him as she would have done in their
old and happy hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dinner passed off, Isabel withdrew, and Lorraine
was alone with his uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you have altered, Henry,” said the old
earl, “you left us a boy, and now your brow is that
of a warrior. Ah! I always knew you would prove
an honor to your house. Another glass of the Burgundy.
But now we are alone, let us hear of your
battles and sieges.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost evening when they rose from the
table, and Lorraine signified his wish to seek the
open air. His uncle pleaded his gout, and the
young knight stepped out upon the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, however, as if led by a mysterious influence,
he sought the old terrace, where he had sat
at Isabel’s feet the last day he had spent at the hall.
His cousin was there. For a moment both were embarrassed.
A woman on such occasions, is always
the first to speak; and Isabel broke the spell by an
allusion to their early days. Long then they conversed;
for both their hearts were full. But neither
spoke of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a golden evening, the very counterpart to
the one he had last spent there, and when, for a few
minutes both paused, it is not improbable that each
reverted to that memorable occasion, and for awhile
they gazed without speaking on the landscape.
And mournful were Lorraine’s thoughts as he gazed.
What was honor, or rank, or wealth to him, since
they brought him not Isabel? But was her love
then hopelessly lost to him? Alas! had not De
Courtenay assured him of her continued affection;
and would it not be even dishonorable to win that
affection if he could? Yet might there not be hope?
Such feelings, whirling through his mind, almost
determined Lorraine, in the excitement of the
moment, to fling himself at Isabel’s feet. Suddenly,
however, two horsemen appeared in the
distance, winding up the avenue of the park.
Isabel and himself started simultaneously, and
looked at each other. Could it be that both
divined in the foremost of the riders the same individual?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment passed, when their ears were aroused
by the rapid clattering of approaching hoofs, and
looking down they beheld a couple of horsemen
spring from their steeds. The eye of one of the
riders happened to fall upon them, and he turned
hastily in their direction. Surely it was not—yes! it
was—De Courtenay. He dashed up the terrace
with eager haste, and Isabel, forgetting, in her glad
surprise, everything except that the lover she had
not seen for years stood before her, rushed forward
to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edward—Edward!” was all the agitated
girl could utter, as she stooped to her half kneeling
lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isabel—dearest Isabel, we meet at last,” passionately
exclaimed De Courtenay, as he looked up,
and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh! who can tell the agony of Lorraine during
that moment? Was it for this he had toiled; was
it for this he had struggled; was it for this he had
breasted the fierce assault? It was the last drop
in his cup of bitterness. His heart was wrung with
unutterable woe. He spoke no word, he breathed
no sigh; but he gazed a moment sadly on the spectacle,
and then noiselessly entered the apartment
behind. When the lovers looked around he was
gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night a solitary traveller might be seen on
the high road to London. He had just parted with
another, who had pursued him hotly for several
miles, and finally overtaken him. The two were
Lorraine and De Courtenay. The latter, learning
every thing from Isabel for the first time, had set
out and overtaken his preserver, with the generous
design to relinquish his mistress to the young knight.
But Lorraine would not listen to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, you tempt me over much,” sadly said
Lorraine, “for can you give me the love of Isabel?
God bless you both. As for me, glory henceforth
is my only mistress. Farewell!” and pressing his
friend’s hand, he plunged his rowels into the flanks
of his steed, and dashed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Courtenay had followed Lorraine to England
unexpectedly within twenty-four hours of the young
knight’s departure, and, having hastily transacted
his business in London, had hurried down to Deraine
hall, and met Lorraine as we have described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of his house ever saw Lorraine again. He
appeared in a few days in the camp, but within a
week fell in an assault, the only man who had succeeded
in mounting the breach. There he fought
unsupported for several minutes, but finally sank
pierced with a hundred wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And long did Isabel and De Courtenay weep for
the ill-fated page. And when the war was over,
and they were married, often would they sit on
that old terrace, and feel a melancholy pleasure in
talking of Lorraine. Need we wonder that their
eldest boy bore the name of Isabel’s unfortunate
cousin? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Some</span> years since I chanced to stop, during one
of my summer rambles, in a pretty village, picturesquely
situated in the county of F——d. I
arrived about sun-set, and the quiet loveliness which
appeared every where around, won me to the spot.
A row of neat white houses, with pretty gardens in
front, arose on each side of the way, for the distance
of nearly half a mile. At this point the road
branched off in different directions, and exactly on
the centre of division stood the village church; a
plain, unpretending edifice, whose slender spire rose
high above the full tops of venerable elms and dark
pendant willows that surrounded its peaceful walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A row of fine trees planted regularly at the
road side, gave the appearance of an avenue to the
village street, which viewed from its entrance, has
an uncommonly pleasing effect, the eye ranging
through the grass-bounded road, and the umbrageous
arch which overshadows it, till the consecrated
building terminates the vista.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country immediately adjoining the village is
divided into numerous enclosures, bearing marks of
good cultivation; while pretty farm-houses are scattered
in every direction, with woods, streams, rocks
and groves, beautifying the landscape. A chain of
hills, which might without the charge of an extraordinary
degree of presumption, aspire to the name
of mountains, bounds the view on the south-east—their
undulating outline beautifully marked against
the clear horizon. Through an opening of the
range, a glimpse is caught of the deep blue waters
of the sound—a sail just distinguished—diminished
by distance to a mere speck, gives frequent interest,
and adds to the magic of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pleasing, however, as was the village, and
abounding in objects most inviting to a lover of
simple life, I determined not to make it my place
of abode. Enquiring my way to a farm-house, of
which I had some previous knowledge, I directed
my steps thither. It was situated about a mile
from the village, at the foot of a gentle slope, and
adjoining a grove vocal in spring-time with the
notes of almost innumerable birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The master of it was a plain farmer, but one of
Heaven’s nobility, an honest man. He lived like
one of the Patriarchs of old, surrounded by his
descendants to the third generation. His still
athletic form was unbent by age, although his
venerable locks were whitened by the snows of
seventy winters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was received with all the kindness I could
wish. Every thing was done to make me comfortable,
and cause me, as the phrase goes, to feel
at home, and I did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-house was a large, old building,
abounding in long, low rooms, the ceilings of
which were crossed by heavy beams, a century
ago considered no defect in architectural embellishment—narrow
windows, glazed with exceedingly
small panes, carefully leaded—a fire-place
built across one corner of the room, over the
mantel-piece of which appeared a wooden clock,
flanked on each side by a china figure, intending
to represent, as I supposed, Flora and Pomona.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former of these heathen beauties balanced
her well-filled basket with sufficient gravity on a
head none of the smallest—but her companion
from the carelessness with which she held her
cornucopia, suffered its treasures to escape with
an indifference truly wonderful. A pair of pink-colored
candles, rising from sockets garnished with
curiously cut paper, finished the decorations of the
fire-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My hostess was a little, fat, short, good-humored
woman, and with her youngest daughter, the only
one remaining unmarried, and a daughter-in-law,
whose husband was absent in a distant part of the
country, constituted those members of the family,
with whom I had most frequent and social communication.
There were, also, two or three large
dogs, of prepossessing physiognomy, and urbane
gentlemanly manners, with whom I soon found a
sort of companionship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the oddities, animate or inanimate,
with which I became acquainted during my visit
to Redbury, I saw none that interested me more
than an urchin who officiated in the family as a
sort of boy of all work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Short, stout, broad-shouldered as an infant Hercules,
with a round, good-humored face, laughing
grey eyes, and elf-locks tanned to a dead flaxey
whiteness, by continual exposure to the sun and
wind—“Our Bill,” for so he was constantly and
familiarly denominated, was to be found every
where, and equal to every imposed duty. He
chopped wood, made the fires, fetched water,
brought the cows, and helped the maids to milk
them; went of all the errands, and did <span class='it'>all the
chores</span>. When the farmer came in wearied from
the field, “Our Bill” ran to the cellar and drew for
his refreshment a mug of hard cider. If an extra
hand was wanted in hay-time or harvest, it was
only to send to the house for “Our Bill.” If a
neighbor was at a loss for a messenger in any
emergency—the first thought was to request of
neighbor Dawkins the loan of “Bill.” In short,
he was in demand for every thing, and I began to
consider him ubiquitous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The readiness with which he complied with every
requisition, his unvarying good-humor and promptness
to oblige, soon drew my attention and gained
my approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first marked kindness which I received from
him I well remember. I was sitting in the apartment
allotted to my use, and taking my breakfast.
The morning was dark, and it rained violently. I
looked toward the windows with a sort of hopelessness
of feeling, for I expected that letters were
lying in the post-office in the village, from my
friends in the city, and I knew not how to procure
them. To be sure I might send “Our Bill,” but I
had not the heart to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While meditating thus, a gentle tap came to my
door. I opened it, and who should appear but
“Our Bill.” His garments were soaked and dripping
with rain, which fell in rapid and discolored
drops from numerous ragged points and edges.
He held his tattered, crownless hat in one hand,
while he extended to me in the other no less than
three letters—three letters from dear friends in
town—how dear, let friendship in absence determine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked up at the windows involuntarily, as I
broke the seal of one missive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why William, (I never could bear to call him
Bill,) you have been to the post-office—and through
all the storm—I hope you did not go entirely on
my account?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I did though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my lad, I never would have sent you
through such a tempest of wind and rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that. But I heard you say last night
that you thought there were letters for you in the
village, so I determined you should have ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a kind boy, Will. Are you not
cold? You had better go quickly and change
your clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Change my clothes, oh no—I don’t mind a
wet jacket. I’ll make a fire up for you though,
if you please,” and he looked at my vacant hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do so,” said I, and while he was engaged I
perused my letters. Their contents were satisfactory
and pleasing, and I sat ruminating on the past,
with no painful anticipations about the future, while
the boy went on with his self-imposed employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” exclaimed he, as a cheerful crackling
flame blazed up the chimney, “I think you’ll do,
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, Willy, and here is something for your
pains.” I handed him a small silver piece. He
took it with a rustic bow, and looked at it with
delight. His face, cheerful before, now grew bright
with pleasure. Down he sat, <span class='it'>sans cérémonie</span>, upon
the hearth, and diving his hand into some unimaginable
recess about his person, brought to light a
dingy-looking rag, which he untied. In it I beheld
a few pieces of copper coin. He added to them
the silver which I had given him, retied his little
bag, thanked me again, and was about to leave the
room. My voice arrested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Willy, you are quite rich; what are you
going to do with so much money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy actually blushed and hung his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you do,” said I, “my man, and may
I not know too?” He was silent. “It will go to
buy tops and marbles, I suppose,” I added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No it won’t,” he answered, with quickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are saving it till you get enough
to purchase a new hat, or a pair of shoes. If so,
I think, you are doing very right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer, and at this moment Mrs. Dawkins
calling him, he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This economy was a trait I little suspected in
my young acquaintance. Most boys of his age
expend the few pence which they casually acquire,
in the purchase of apples, or nuts, or gingerbread,
but I never saw “Our Bill” indulge in any luxuries
of this sort. I, therefore, could only return to my
first supposition, that he was hoarding up the means
of buying a Sunday jacket, trowsers, shoes or hat.
The chief things that I disapproved of, about the
boy, were the indifference which he evinced as to
his appearance, and his love of mischief. It is true
he had not much time to devote to personal neatness;
yet numerous as were his avocations, there
was not a solitary scheme of mischief carried into
effect within a mile of the village, in which Bill did
not bear a part. If mammy Jennings’s orchard
was to be thinned of its superfluous number of
golden pippins—or cross-grained old Squire Grummand’s
fine walnut tree laid under contribution—or
the Deacon’s melon-patch to be <span class='it'>examined</span> by moonlight,
I am sorry to say that “Our Bill” was sure
to be an assistant, if not officiating as president of
the board of directors. In short, he was a mischievous,
but good-natured and obliging boy, that
might by a little care exercised by some kind-hearted
individual, be rendered a good and useful
member of the community. But if neglected and
suffered to grow up in idleness, or desultory employment,
which is next akin to it, he stood a fair
chance of falling into a career of dissipation, profligacy
and vice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took an early opportunity of enquiring more
particularly about this boy of Mrs. Dawkins: who
gave me the following account. His parents, who
were natives of the village, and poor, had married
early in life. They were industrious—the man
particularly so—and they were virtuous and honest.
For some time after their marriage the world went
hardly with them. An increase of family brought
an increase of cares and want, with no additional
means wherewith to answer them. James Lee
(that was his name) became dejected—and Nancy
unfortunately lost not her cheerfulness only, but her
good temper: and although James worked hard
from day to day, and gave her every penny of his
earnings, to lay up or expend in supplying the wants
of the family, as she chose; yet she was still peevish
and dissatisfied. Harassed by his wife’s growing
ill-temper, and threatened by all the evils attendant
upon increasing poverty, James began to seek in
company at the village tavern a temporary relief
from care. This only made matters worse; Nancy
instead of striving to make his home pleasant, and
soothing his uneasiness, by bidding him hope for the
best, always met him with tears and upbraidings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus matters went on for some time, when one
day as Mrs. Lee was about heating her oven for a
baking of bread, she found that there was no oven
wood cut. Her husband always prepared the wood
for her in the nicest manner; but he had somehow
or other forgotten to do so at this time. Instead
of going quietly out to him where he sat at work
in the little shop, opposite their house, (he was a
shoemaker by trade) she began by angrily accusing
him of negligence, and want of consideration for
her comfort—with sundry reflections on the manner
in which he had too frequently passed his hours of
late, to the great detriment of both purse and credit.
He heard all she had to say with exemplary patience;
and when she had finished arose from his
bench, and walked to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to get the oven-wood?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Anne,” he replied meekly, and walked
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lee returned to her kitchen, and remained
waiting for the wood till a good hour had elapsed.
Out of all patience, she at last sent her daughter, a
fine, stout lass, of ten years, to hurry her father,
bidding her tell him her bread would be entirely
ruined by waiting so long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl went, but searched for her father in
vain, returning to the house only to give an account
of her ill success. The displeasure of her
mother was again excited, and she sallied forth
herself, fully determined on giving James a piece of
her mind. But James was no where to be seen.
The wood lay uncut. His shop was still open—the
tools which he had been recently employing,
lay on a bench beside that on which he had been
sitting. In short, every thing remained just as he
had left it one short hour before; but from that
time to this, a period of seven years, James Lee
has never been heard of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a surprising story,” said I, when the
good dame had concluded, “what do people suppose
became of Lee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no telling,” answered Mrs. Dawkins,
“some say one thing and some another. Whether
he left the country—or whether he made away with
himself, there’s nobody knows—for my own part
I think he was harassed out of his life by the odd
temper of his good woman—but there’s no knowing—well,
this here boy, that you’ve been asking
about is her son. She has but two children left—Nancy,
who is about seventeen, and ‘Our Bill.’
My husband took the boy, to keep him out of evil
courses, and if he behaves himself, Mr. Dawkins
will do well by him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is certainly very kind of your husband,
and I hope the lad will reward him by industry
and good conduct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, too,” replied my hostess, “but Bill is
rather too much inclined to mischief—yet he is a
good boy, too, in many respects, and is very fond
of his mother, whom he goes to see regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are her means of support?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—she has to work hard enough since the
loss of her husband; and many a time I have seen
her standing in the doorway, looking over at the
little shop in which he used to sit at work, with
her eyes brimful of tears. Ah, I guess it goes to
her heart to think how roughly she used to speak
to poor James. She takes in spinning and plain
work, and sometimes goes out a nursing; and her
daughter does a little at millinery, for she has a
pretty taste about such matters; and so they make
out a living.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the daughter industrious?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As industrious a girl as you would wish to see,
and as handsome. She has a lover too; indeed a
couple of them; but there her mother and she are
at odds; for the one that Nancy likes is not favored
by Mrs. Lee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unfortunate; and what kind of a person
is the young man preferred by Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he is a likely lad—the blacksmith of our
village. He has not much before hand to be sure,
but is honest, good, and true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he is better off—quite rich. Keeps a store
in the village, and makes a great dash. But for
my own part I think Nancy’s choice is the best;
for Josiah Goodwin is steady as a clock, while
folks do say, that young Sturges, the shop-keeper,
likes a small spree now and then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is the case,” said I, “it is to be hoped
that Nancy will remain firm in her determination
to have nothing to do with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a sad time of it at any rate,” replied
my informant. “Her mother keeps her close at
home, and has ordered her never to see or speak to
young Goodwin; who is so troubled about it, that
he has closed his shop and left the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” said I, “I am sorry for this poor girl,
and I should like to pay a visit to Mrs. Lee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you may do this evening, if you please,”
said Mrs. Dawkins, “my daughter is going to her
house to carry some work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The circumstances of Mrs. Lee’s case as respected
her husband, greatly interested me; my
curiosity was awakened, and I agreed to accompany
Lizzy Dawkins. At the hour appointed we
set out together. After a pleasant walk through
winding roads, and shady lanes, we arrived at the
cottage of Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an humble abode, unmarked by any exterior
improvement. One large sycamore grew in
front, and threw a portion of its branches across
the moss-grown roof. A rustic bench was placed
at the foot of the tree. This had been done by
James, in the earlier days of wedded love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of the house stood partly open, and
Lizzy, taking the privilege of an old acquaintance,
entered without knocking. I followed. We walked
into the kitchen, which large, clean and comfortable,
served as a reception room. I must acknowledge
that my first glance was directed toward the oven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy greeted us with a kindly welcome; but
the first object that drew my attention was “Our
Bill,” standing by the side of his mother, and
emptying the contents of his dingy-looking purse
into her lap. In seeing us enter he started, and
looked as much confused as if he had been caught
in some act of delinquency. A look from me gave
him courage. I saw at once for what purpose the
money had been saved, and from that moment
determined that while I lived Bill should never
want a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Lizzy had delivered the work which she
had brought for her neighbor, the conversation fell
upon different matters. Nancy, however, bore but
a small part therein; she seemed absent and sad.
A young female friend of hers came in, and she
made an effort to appear more cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now the season when whortleberries were
in their prime; and Bill was exceedingly anxious
that a party should be formed for gathering them
in the neighboring wood. Nancy’s young friend
joined warmly in the project. Lizzy Dawkins was
pleased with the arrangement. I agreed to make
one of the number. Nancy evinced small interest
in the matter, though she agreed to go with us if
her mother was willing: and as the good dame
was relieved from her apprehensions on the score
of Goodwin, since she had learned that he had left
the village, she gave her assent. The following
day was fixed upon for our little excursion; and as
the weather proved fine, we accordingly went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wood was not far distant from the house of
Mrs. Lee. It was wild, shady, and beautiful: the
resort of the squirrel and the rabbit—gay with innumerable
wild-flowers, and vocal with the sweet
music of its feathered denizens. Numerous openings
amid the thickets disclosed irregular knolls,
covered with the shrubby bushes which now hung
full of the purple berry of which we came in search,
and whose abundance in many past years had given
to this rural spot the name of Whortleberry, or in
village nomenclature, Huckle-berry wood. We soon
met with two or three other parties on the same
errand with ourselves: some acquaintances of Lizzy
and Nancy were among them: we united our forces,
filled our baskets with berries, and chatted and
laughed the hours away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about noon, when, tired and rather hungry,
we concluded to seek for a shady spot where
we might rest, and partake of the refreshment with
which we had taken the precaution to provide ourselves.
Bill, who had acted the part of master of
the ceremonies during the whole of the day, now
preceded us, boasting aloud of his superior skill in
discovering a cool and pleasant spot for the purpose
we desired. After a few turns among the bushes
and underwood, we suddenly emerged upon the
borders of a broad and rapid brook, which was
murmuring its way most delightfully among the
reeds and wild-flowers that graced its margin. And
here we were at a stand. To arrive at the spot
designated by our young conductor, and represented
by him as the best in the wood, it was necessary
that we should cross the stream; but how to do so
was the question. Bill suggested the placing a few
large stones in the bed of the river, by means of
which we might easily step across. This was accordingly
done; and Bill, taking his sister by the
hand, preceded the rest of the party, who paused
while they marked the progress of the adventurers
across their unsteady footway. As soon as they
touched the opposite margin, a loud shout from
Bill electrified us. “A rattle-snake! a rattle-snake!
run—run for your lives!” and forgetful of the courage
which I had hitherto seen him assume on
almost every occasion, Bill dragged his terrified sister
up the rough bank, and disappeared with her in
the thick groves beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cry had affrighted all. Each one ran in a
different direction from his fellow, and each thought
the rattle-snake close at his heels. The panic
could scarcely have been greater had a boa-constrictor
appeared wreathing its voluminous folds
among the branches of the beech, walnut, and oak,
that rustled above our heads. It was sorrowful to
see the labors of the morning scattered in a moment,
for many of the well-filled baskets, overturned by
their respective owners in the precipitation of their
flight, poured their purple treasure among moss,
lichens, and fern-blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, I looked in vain for the reptile
which had caused this alarm, and finding myself
left entirely alone, I concluded to follow the footsteps
of the valorous William and his gentle sister.
Crossing the stream, and clambering the bank on
the opposite side, I found myself in a charming
grove of tall young trees of rapid growth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was still, save the whistle of the robin, or the
solitary call of the cat-bird. I wandered along,
almost forgetful of the cause which brought me
hither, when at the entrance of a thicket of young
hazels, seated at the end of a fallen tree, and leisurely
employed in stripping the bark from a sapling
branch, which he seemed desirous of forming into
something resembling a walking stick, I discovered
“Our Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprised at the quiet in which I beheld him,
contrasted as it was with his late trepidation and
alarm, I immediately accosted him with enquiries
after his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t far, I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know where she is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—stop a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know if she is not hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt?—what should hurt her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The snake, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy grinned archly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill,” said I, “what has become of that snake,
think you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think there really was any there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sartain I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said I, advancing, “I shall continue my
search till I find Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy started up, and putting his fingers to his
mouth, blew a shrill whistle. I looked at him, in
order to discover, if I could, the end and aim of this
new fantasy. A rustle among the bushes at a little
distance was heard. I turned my eyes in the direction
of the sound. There was Nancy, and by
her side, one of his arms encircling her waist, stood
as fine and good-looking a country youth as one
would wish to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were about parting,—a few more last
words—a kiss and then farewell. Nancy came
tripping toward the spot where she had left her
brother, but on seeing me stopped and looked confused.
I hastened to re-assure her; and quickly retracing
our steps to the brook-side as a sort of
rendezvous, we soon were joined by our companions.
So much for the strategy of “Our Bill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gathering up our fruit as well as we were able,
we pursued our way through the mazes of “Huckle-berry”
wood. Bill who had been for some time in
advance of our party, now came running toward us
announcing our near approach to the house of Betty
Nares the fortune-teller. “The fortune-teller—the
fortune-teller” was echoed from lip to lip. And,
“who will have their fortune told?” was asked of
each, by the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we came in sight of Betty’s dwelling.
A lowly roof it literally was; for a person would
scarcely be able to stand upright except in the
midst of the only apartment which it contained, so
lowly and sloping was the roof,—so covered with
moss and lichens, that it resembled a green hillock
surrounded by trees. The interior was such as
might have been expected from its outward appearance.
An earthen floor; a stool with three legs;
an empty barrel, the elastic end of which answered
the purposes of a table; a glazed earthen pipkin; a
bowl or two; a wooden platter and spoon, completed
the number and variety of Betty’s furniture and
culinary utensils. A bundle of something indescribable—rolled
up in one corner, was supposed to be
the couch on which this modern sybil reposed her
wearied limbs. A heap of stones formed the fire-place—and
an aperture in the roof answered the
purpose of a chimney in so far as a portion of the
smoke occasionally made its escape thereat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found the mistress of this inviting retreat
seated beside a few dying embers, over which she
extended her withered hand, seeking to animate
their torpidity by artificial heat. On seeing us she
rose, and presented to our view a veritable hag-like
face and form. Her garments were tattered, her
shoes decayed, and her grey locks imperfectly
covered by a dilapidated bonnet. She saluted us
in a shrill voice, and, in no very gentle terms, demanded
to know our business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this was a question we were not altogether
prepared to answer, each looked at his neighbor,
desirous that he or she should expound. Betty,
finding us silent, and growing rather impatient, commenced
an objurgation in a high key, accompanied
by a few ominous flourishes with a stunted broom
which she snatched from a corner near her fire-place.
At this moment Bill stepped up to her, and
in a low voice made some communication which
had the effect of mollifying her at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wish to have your fortunes told, gentlemen
and ladies?” said she, addressing us with an
attempt at looking gracious. One of the village
girls presented her a small piece of money, while
Betty, from some private nook, brought out a terribly
soiled pack of cards, the corners worn by
constant attrition, and the edges blackened by
frequent devotion to the service of the curious in the
prescient art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was amusing to see the interest displayed. The
cards were cut and divided. Attention became fixed.
The fair enquirer into the mysteries of the future,
placed before this modern oracle, looked pale and
red by turns. And now we were informed of a
strange man who would soon arrive and bring good
news to a certain family not many miles off. And
of a dark-haired woman who was a friend, and of a
light-haired woman who was an enemy, to the
young enquirer. How a journey would be made to
a distant land, and how somebody of fair complexion
and immense wealth was to come over the
water and offer himself a candidate for her fair hand.
There were letters to be expected without number,
and presents to be sent without name. At each
separate piece of intelligence sly looks were exchanged
among the circle; meaning smiles, and
conscious glances. “How wonderfully true!” “Surprising!”
“How she could have known such or
such a circumstance, it was hard to tell, but so it
was. She seemed to know every thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Lee could not be prevailed upon to enquire
into the circumstances of her future lot, and
by such neglect considerably displeased Betty; and
to pacify her, Bill invited her to his mother’s house
the following evening. To which arrangement
she at last graciously consented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all returned home cheerful and happy; well
pleased with our day’s excursion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following evening I walked out to see Mrs.
Lee, curious I must own, to learn the proceedings
of Betty Nares in persuading Nancy to have her
fortune told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Mrs. Lee as usual in her neat kitchen.
She was sitting quietly there, for the business of the
day was finished, and that of the evening, which
consisted generally of knitting or spinning, was not
yet begun. Nancy was sitting on a low stool by
the side of her mother, and I thought she looked as
if she had been weeping. The milk pans had been
placed away, filled with their simple treasure. The
chairs stood aside, the hearth was swept up, and all
things looked the very abode of quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last beams of the setting sun shone through
the open door, and threw a soft purple tint across the
humble apartment, which was reflected by a row of
brightly burnished tin pans—proofs of the industry
and neatness of Nancy—which decorated the opposite
wall—and—just as the last tints faded away,
a cricket from some crevice in the rural hearth-stone
commenced tuning his “tiny reed.”—It was
the hour of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lee began to wonder why her son had not
returned. He had been absent she said, for two
hours in “Huckle-berry” wood. She wished with
all her heart that the season of gathering berries
was over. She dreaded every day when farmer
Dawkins would get out of patience with his idling,
and send him home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she was speaking the window became
darkened by some opaque body, and on looking up
we recognised the head of Betty Nares. Directly
the fortune-teller entered, and took a seat near the
fire-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Bill came in. “Well,” he exclaimed
on seeing Betty, “I’m glad you are here. Now
mother do just let her tell Nancy’s fortune. She
told a power of things to Lucy Harroby and Kitty
Dixon, and all of ’em came true—now do, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a simpleton, Bill. I have no faith in
such stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at Nancy—she smiled faintly but said
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t believe me,” said the sybil—“you
won’t believe me I suppose, if I tell you that you
yourself are soon to be married?” I must confess
that I thought this a bold and daring assertion of
Betty, and calculated to strike at the root of all her
hopes of success: as Mrs. Lee was known to be
scrupulously correct and reserved in her deportment,
most particularly since the mysterious departure of
her husband. As I expected, Betty received a look
of disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not look so scornful, Mrs. Lee,” said
Betty, “what I tell you is true, and you can’t get
aside of it. And I’ll tell you more. The man you
want your daughter to marry, is going to meet with
a great deal of trouble in his worldly matters,—and
the one you don’t wish her to have is likely to be a
rich man—and more—the day you give your consent
that Nancy shall marry Goodwin, a stranger
from across the water will come here, and give her
a dowry that shall set them both well a going in
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Lee in great displeasure asked Betty if she
really supposed “that she had lost her senses, that
she should for one minute be induced to credit such
idle trash.” Betty however, kept her ground, and
repeated her opinions with a tenacity that surprised
me. Bill still continued to entreat. Nancy hid
her face in her hands, and burst into tears. Mrs.
Lee scolded, and Betty solemnly shaking her head,
declared she “had her knowledge from one who
would not lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling my presence, in the existing circumstances,
rather an incumbrance, I rose to take
leave. This I did, just as Bill was blowing a coal
in order to light a candle, and Betty was beginning
to shuffle her cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some particular business of my own, prevented
me for a few days from inquiring into the civil and
domestic relations of the House of Lee. I saw
however, that my friend Bill was still in action.
Indeed he seemed more busy than ever. How the
boy sustained such a constant course of riding and
running, of chopping and lugging, of cattle-driving
and hog-feeding, with numerous other et ceteras, all
generally terminating—of late—in an excursion to
“Huckle-berry” wood, I could scarcely imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wishing one morning to speak to my hostess, I
went to the kitchen; secure of finding her there,—that
being the seat of empire, with a good New-England
house-wife. For once, however, I was
disappointed; but there sat Bill. Returned from
some nameless excursion, he was eating a late
breakfast. It was rather picturesque. His naked
feet, stained by the soil through which he had lately
plodded, were raised upon the cross piece of his
chair—his knees appearing through two very unnecessary
apertures in his nether garment—his
ragged hat lying on the floor at his feet, and two
large house-dogs seated on the ground—one on each
side, watching with eager interest each morsel that
he conveyed to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that I was somewhat anxious on the
score of Bill’s health; but when I saw the devotion
with which he applied himself to his hashed pork
and potatoes, and the complacency with which
from time to time he eyed a smoking dish of
pumpkin-pudding which stood close at his elbow,
waiting his acceptance, I comforted myself with the
belief that the means and appliances with which he
strengthened his inward man, would abundantly
enable him to sustain the labors which heaven had
allotted to his share.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had long been the best of friends, and perfectly
understood each other. He looked up at me
with his laughing grey eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Nance is going to be married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say so—Bill, are you in earnest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill nodded, for by this time his mouth was again
full, and he could not speak. He took a draught
of cider from the great brown jug on the table.
“Yes, it’s true enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to whom is she to be married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Siah Goodwin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, what could have brought about such
a change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How has it all happened, Bill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Betty Nares told Mother it <span class='it'>was to be</span>; so
how could she hinder it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, very true. Well, when is the wedding to
take place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow evening—won’t you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,—we shall have a main sight of pumpkin
pies; mother says it will be like a training day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was it possible that the artful and ignorant
Betty had succeeded in imposing upon the plain
good sense of Mrs. Lee? I was sure there must be
more in it than at first sight appeared. However,
I determined to be at the wedding. On enquiry, I
found that the Dawkinses were invited, and also that
they were as much surprised at the turn affairs had
taken as myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next evening we all repaired to the house of
Mrs. Lee. On entering her little parlor, we found
a few of the neighbors assembled. Nancy sat near
a window, and beside her one whom I supposed to
be the bridegroom. I thought that I recognised in
him the same young man whom I had seen with
her in Huckle-berry wood. My doubts, if I had any
remaining, would soon have been dissipated by her
brother, who walking up to me, and looking expressively
in my face, and putting two of his fingers
to his mouth, produced in a subdued tone a sound
resembling the hissing of a snake. The whole truth
flashed upon me at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exterior of Bill himself was greatly improved,
dressed as he was for the occasion, in a good suit
of home-spun cloth, his feet covered with a decent
pair of leather shoes, and his flaxen hair combed
smoothly over his forehead, cut short and even all
round, with the exception of two pendant locks, left
as a partial covering to his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every thing was now in readiness, and we waited
only for the clergyman who had been sent for to
perform the marriage ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock came to the door. Bill flew to open it.—“Here
he is.” “That’s he”—was whispered
around—“No, not yet.”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fidgetty restlessness took possession of the
party. Steps were heard outside. The door again
opened, and Bill appeared preceding a stranger. He
was dressed like a plain countryman, of good-looking
face and appearance, and he bore in his arms a
rather unusual burthen, supposing him to be a
traveller. He advanced into the middle of the room.
Mrs. Lee rose from her seat and stared at him
wildly. The stranger extended his hand to her
smiling. “Nancy,” said he, “<span class='it'>I’ve brought in the
oven-wood</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor woman gave one shriek and fell on the
floor. Down went the wood on the hearth, and
the stranger flew to her assistance. Slowly she
regained her senses, and when she did so, she threw
herself in the arms of the new comer and wept
aloud. We all crowded around, eager for an explanation.
It was soon given. James Lee, distressed
by poverty, and worn by the fretful temper
of his wife, had, on the memorable morning of his
disappearance—on the impulse of the moment, resolved
to quit his home and seek his fortune in a
foreign clime. For this act, his only apology was
the bitterness of despair. He sought the nearest
port, and embarked as a common sailor on board a
vessel about sailing to the West-Indies. Changing
his name that he might not be traced, he made
himself useful, and became a favorite with his captain:
was generally esteemed, and by degrees
enabled to traffic a little on his own account. He
had made many voyages and been unusually successful.
He had acquired a snug competence with
which he now returned, for the purpose of enjoying
it in the bosom of his family. As he approached
his home, the recollection of the manner in which
he had left it suddenly occurred to him, and when
Bill opened the door, the thought struck him that
he would go to the wood-pile, fill his arms with
wood, and thus bring to his wife’s mind, for the
joke’s sake, the remembrance of their parting scene,
seven years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had concluded, and we had offered our
congratulations on this happy event, a shrill voice
was heard to exclaim,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you so—didn’t I say you were
going to be married, Miss Lee—hasn’t everything
I said come to pass—didn’t I tell you?”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” said Mrs. Lee, smiling, “you told
me, as you tell others of things to happen which
you take good care to find out before-hand.” Betty
looked rather blank when she found that no credit
was allowed her for her skill in prescience, more
especially as “Our Bill” in the pride and fullness of
his heart unfolded the secret of his numerous expeditions
to the wood. Here at Goodwin’s farm
which was in the immediate neighborhood, Lee had
remained for a few days till the harmless plot which
he laid in conjunction with the young man was ripe
for development, and his wife had given her consent
to his daughter’s marriage with “Siah.” It
is scarcely necessary to say that Bill had met and
recognised his father—been made privy to his and
Goodwin’s scheme, and in short, been active agent
in the whole affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several years have passed since that period.
William Lee has grown to man’s estate. He is
married and has a snug little home of his own.
He is a carpenter by trade, and fills a respectable
station in the community of which he is a member.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my own part, I love to think over the past,
for many a pleasing idea is connected with the reminiscences
of “Huckle-berry” wood, and “Our Bill.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='uneq'></a>UNEQUALLY YOKED.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY REV. J. KENNADAY.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Why</span> don’t you hurry, woman? Sure it is no
wonder that the child sleeps in your arms. And
yourself will be asleep next, if you walk at this
creeping rate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be patient, William. You know that the
mountain is steep; the child is heavy; and it’s but
little strength I have, any way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was part of a dialogue I chanced to hear,
while passing the parties, who were clambering up
one of the most rugged roads in the Catskill mountains;
a road so steep indeed, that my horse puffed
at every step, and the saddle creaked beneath me as
I grasped the pummel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was some twelve or fifteen feet in
advance of the woman, and at the sound of my
horse’s feet, paused till I passed, when he turned the
hasty glance of his eye from me, in a heavy frown
upon her whom he upbraided. A light breath of
wind touching the hood, together with the effort of
the woman to step aside from the road till I passed,
laid open the face of the sleeping child, and gave
evidence, in the fullness of its face, of the weight of
its frame, and of health, derived almost at the
expense of the one upon whose bosom it reposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possessing an enormous and hardy frame, the
man trode the mountain path almost with the step
of an elephant, and appeared to require nothing but
a palanquin upon his huge shoulders to enable him
to carry both the mother and the babe. The
woman was of small and delicate form. Her face
was round and very fair, over which was cast the
mildness of a bright but modest eye. Although her
age was about thirty, she appeared at least fifteen
years younger than her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bend in the road, and the rapid walk of my
horse, soon led me so far in advance, that I ceased
farther to hear a dialogue which, as far as it was
heard, intimated the unfeeling character of the one,
and satisfied me that the other had ample opportunity
to manifest her piety in the perfect working of
her patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the progress of another mile of the ascending
road, I came to a pass, where, in a close of about
half an acre of level land, there stood a little hut,
immediately on the side of the road. The building
was formed of large unhewn logs, interlaid with
clay. The door, swinging upon hinges made of the
soles of worn-out shoes, being partially open, disclosed
the scanty and mutilated furniture within.
There was only one window, consisting of a slender
sash, designed for four small panes of glass, but in
which only two remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the poverty indicated in the
appearance of every thing presented to my view,
there was a general neatness with which I was
forcibly struck. A thrifty honey-suckle climbed up
the little hut, and the garden was much enlivened
by a variety of lovely flowers. I know not how
correct the criterion may be found by others, but
my observations have long since confirmed me in the
accuracy of the inference that, however humble or
elegant a country dwelling-house may be, wherever
there is a choice collection of flowers in the garden,
there is usually taste and cleanliness within the
dwelling. The approach of a little boy and girl to
the door of this humble hut, with coarse but well
mended apparel, and the sedate and polite manner in
which they expressed their obeisance as I passed,
satisfied me that the mistress of this cot possessed
feelings worthy of a better home. The manners of
the children were the more perceptible, as they
could not have been acquired at school, in as much
as in this section of the mountains, schools are
seldom heard of. I knew of but one school-house
within a distance of three miles from these children,
and that was open only during three months of the
year, and when those who attended must wade
through highland snows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another mile brought me to my place of destination,
the glass-works, consisting of a low, spacious,
sombre frame building, standing in a field, every
where studded with the most formidable stumps of
the hemlock, a tree the most common in these
mountains, and the most majestic in its growth.
With a trunk measuring from five to eight feet in
diameter, and rising more than a hundred feet high,
this tree seems the fitting plumage of the mountain
it adorns. Scattered at various distances from the
glass factory were a few buildings, which, from their
dilapidated appearance, evidenced that their inmates
would never suffer persecution for belonging to a
suspected aristocracy. Perhaps, however, I ought
to except one building which stood in palace-like
contrast with the rest, and adjoined the “factory-store.”
This was the mansion of my friend, Dr. ——,
physician, agent of the glass-works, justice of
the peace, keeper of the store, and frequently member
of the Legislature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, with as much authority as is sometimes
possessed by a continental prince, the Doctor resided,
enjoying the character of a “people’s-man.” Strange
as it might appear, yet it is certain that the glass-blowers
and wood choppers seldom remove from
under his “agency,” without having a balance
against them on the Doctor’s book, either for
rent, medical attendance, justice, groceries or gin.
He, it is true, got rich, yet no one ventured to
question his integrity, or to doubt his protection of
the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until the following day that I was
able to gratify my curiosity by going into the
factory. The blower, at the furnace nearest to
which I stood, soon gave his instrument to another,
and kindly tendered his services to accompany me
through the works, and to give me the information
respecting the process of glass-blowing, of which I
was in quest. We had passed only one or two men
before I perceived, at one of the furnaces, the man
whom I passed in ascending the mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that man?” said I, to my guide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is Bill Hunter,” said he, “and a great
bear he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know him well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ faith I do,” said the man, whose broad dialect
had shown before this that he was an Englishman.
“I have known him this many a year. A
fine woman is she, his wife, but a dog’s life it is, she
has with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He drinks, I suspect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he does; but he’s a bad man when sober;
and it was a dark day for her when she left her
father’s house for such a dolt as Hunter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know something of their history, I
presume. Did you know her father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, John Shaw of Spittlefields! indeed I
knew him well, and it’s all good I know of him.
Sure, a better man there never lived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My curiosity is quite awake my friend,” said I,
“and you will greatly gratify me by giving me a
little of their history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! but it is a sorry history for her, poor
woman,” said he. “Do you see, then, her father
was a wealthy manufacturer, and much thought on.
When Margaret was about fourteen years of age,
he took this same Hunter into his factory and store
to be a kind of porter or runner. For the purpose
of aiding in family errands, he boarded in Mr.
Shaw’s house. At the end of a year, the father
discovered that Margaret treated Hunter’s addresses
with favor, and in disgust and chagrin dismissed
him from his employ; not because he was poor, but
that he was so <span class='it'>ould</span>. We, who knew him, thought
it was strange that the poor wench could think any
thing of such a surly, selfish fellow. But then he
was good-looking, and as slender as ye. It was
not long before the whole town was in a stir, when
it was said that Shaw’s Margaret had gone to the
States with Hunter. Sure enough, it was true; for
it was found out that under pretended names they
had sailed from Liverpool for Philadelphia. The
vessel, however, went into Wilmington, in the state
of Delaware, where they were married and went
into the country, and found employment in a factory.
He was ever a low fellow and a fool, was Mr. Shaw,
for admitting him under his roof. About three
years since, he came to this place poor enough.
For Margaret’s sake, poor girl, whom I knew
when the whole town was proud of her, I gave
him an insight into this business. He scratches a
scanty living, having five children, and lives in the
hut that you passed down the mountain a piece.
He is but a brute to her, who shares a hard life on
it, poor thing; and must ever repent leaving a
father’s house for one so unworthy of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this simple narrative I was much interested,
and not the less so because it was to me an additional
evidence of what I had often thought to be
the case, that in the humbler walks of life, and in
some of the scenes, of poverty and suffering, there
are those often who spend years of pain in weeping
over the inadvertence of the hour in which their
affections were misplaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Do</span> you believe, cousin Grace, that the world
is as disinterested as it was in the days of the
‘<span class='it'>preux chevaliers, sans peur et sans reproche</span>?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, Frank; and even though you quote the
great Edmund Burke, you will not convince me
that the days of chivalry are gone! The days of
knight-errantry are passed away, and well is it for
society that they are so, but there is as much of
the true chivalric spirit now existing as was to be
found in the time of Richard of the Lion Heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you really believe this, Grace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me retaliate by another question, cousin
Frank; do you believe that all the knights and
squires of olden time were inspired purely by a
noble desire to win fame and redress wrongs? Did
not avarice, ambition, selfish gratification, and love
of wild excitement mingle their elements then, even
as they do now, in the mass of human feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly the grosser passions were often
commingled with the better qualities of man’s
nature; selfishness existed, but was not then so
widely diffused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There we differ, Frank; the selfishness of
modern times certainly shows itself in less fearful
shapes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because society has been compelled to make
laws to protect itself against those who would
sacrifice all things to their own will; ‘might no
longer makes right,’ and therefore the selfishness
of human nature is shown less in high-handed
spoliations than in secret machinations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Frank, that there is enough, aye, and to
spare of selfishness on earth I do not mean to
dispute; but I still adhere to my first assertion
that there is no lack of the true chivalric spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pray how does it exhibit its qualities in
this very dull and prosaic world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disinterestedness, self-devotion, purity of intention,
integrity of principle, delicacy of sentiment, a
high-toned sense of honor, and indomitable courage—these
are the essential qualities of a chivalric
character; and surely, Frank, there is no want of
arenas in which to exercise these virtues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find few knights ready to enter the
lists if such are the requisites, cousin Grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you are mistaken in your estimate of
men, Frank; I have a better opinion of your sex
than to adopt your ideas. But if it be as you say,
if selfishness be so active a principle among <span class='it'>men</span>,
then have the virtues taken up their abode in the
hearts of <span class='it'>women</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they possess the chivalric spirit, Grace?—courage
and all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not laugh, I can prove what I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Grace, I am willing to allow your sex
all superiority in goodness and purity of feeling, but
the virtues of women are of a passive nature,—they
have fortitude to suffer, patience to endure,
but rarely energy to act. Men <span class='it'>make</span> sacrifices—women
<span class='it'>suffer</span> them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How little you know of the sex when you
make such an assertion, Frank. A woman’s sacrifices
are of daily and hourly occurrence; she
lives but to minister to others, and to forget
herself. If her courage is of a more passive
nature it is because her sphere of action is very
properly limited. She is not called to stem the
tide of battle, or to face death in warrior’s array;
but is it nothing to look calmly upon the king of
terrors in the chamber of pestilence—to wait for
his fatal blow, with placid fortitude, when assailed
by sudden peril—to gaze, unmoved, upon the weltering
wave—or to perish with unquailing courage
amid flames and tortures? Yet all this has been
done by women. Awaken but a woman’s feelings,
arouse the hidden strength of her affections, and
earth holds not a peril which she will not brave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are eloquent, cousin Grace, but you
scarcely make out your own case; according to
your own evidence woman must have a personal
motive for action; her strength of character must
be called forth by some individual affection, or to
use a less gentle term, by some selfish impulse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to your way of viewing character,
then, Frank, the noblest impulses of our nature
arise from selfishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to hear you draw a parallel between
the sexes, cousin Grace; you seem to be so
impartial—to concede so much goodness to <span class='it'>man’s</span>
fallen nature, while you exalt so highly the weaker
sex, that I am a little curious to know how you
would distinguish them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would probably only dispute my positions,
and make a jest of my distinctions, Frank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will promise to do neither, Grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then listen to the opinions of one who
is content with the dispensations of Providence,
and who believes that the finger of God himself
has marked out the line which separates the impulses,
the habits, the character of the two sexes:—Man
has <span class='it'>vigor</span>—woman <span class='it'>refinement</span>: man has the
<span class='it'>reasoning</span> faculty best developed—woman the <span class='it'>perceptive</span>:
man has the power of <span class='it'>abstraction</span>—woman
<span class='it'>rarely</span> possesses it: man is the creature of <span class='it'>calculation</span>—woman
of <span class='it'>impulse</span>: man is capable of deep
research, he proceeds slowly and cautiously, measuring
every distance, and counting every step of
his progress—woman bounds along with rapid foot,
observing the most prominent objects in her path,
and from them forms conclusions often erroneous,
but always ingenious. The intellectual faculty in
man is usually concentrated—in woman it is diffused:
men of genius commonly devote themselves
to some one favorite pursuit—women of genius are
remarkable for their versatility. Man has the more
correct <span class='it'>judgment</span>—woman the more correct <span class='it'>feelings</span>.
He has a <span class='it'>knowledge</span> of right which he
often forgets—she a <span class='it'>consciousness</span> of it which
never forsakes her, even in the midst of crime:
man possesses the stronger <span class='it'>passions</span>—woman the
stronger <span class='it'>affections</span>: man has <span class='it'>boldness</span>—woman
<span class='it'>fortitude</span>: man can perform heroic deeds—woman
can endure the extreme of suffering: man has the
more <span class='it'>physical</span> daring—woman the more <span class='it'>moral</span>
courage: man controls others by the <span class='it'>force</span> of his
character—woman influences by the <span class='it'>gentleness</span> of
hers. In a word, my dear Frank, the relative
position of the sexes is fixed beyond all change;
their respective duties are well defined. Man has
been given the weapons of moral and mental <span class='it'>warfare</span>,
that he may go out into the world, and do
battle with and for his fellows—while on woman
is bestowed that skill in moral and mental <span class='it'>culture</span>
which enables her to improve the field of duty at
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very clearly defined, cousin Grace; so then
you do not agree in opinion with those who are for
enlarging the boundaries of woman’s domain, and
would fain make her a gladiator in the arena, instead
of a spectator in the amphitheatre of action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That women have some wrongs to be redressed
is an undoubted fact, but I am no friend to this
new warfare for the ‘<span class='it'>rights of women</span>;’ let the sex
only do their duty at home to parents, brothers,
husbands, or friends, and they will have little cause
to repine that the forum, the pulpit, or the poll is
closed against them. But I have not forgotten
your innuendoes respecting the selfishness of women,
Frank, and I should like to tell you a story which
will convince you of how much self-devotion a
woman may be capable, even when the strongest
passions of her nature are to be subdued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny Wilbank was one of those patient, long
suffering creatures, who seem sent into the world
to fulfil the command, ‘<span class='it'>Bear ye one another’s burdens</span>,’
for from her very childhood she had borne
the burdens of the whole family. Her father, one
of those good-hearted, thoughtless prodigals, who,
in their readiness to help other people, are apt to
forget their own interests, had been all his life
unfortunate. Nothing seemed to succeed in his
hands—the most promising business was sure to
fail if he undertook it, and as his family increased
his means diminished, until they were reduced to
the utmost straits to preserve that respectability of
station in which they were born and bred. Fanny
was the eldest of the family, and of course upon
her devolved the duty of assisting her sickly mother
in the care of the children, and the management of
their household. Here was a wide field for the
exercise of self-denial and patience. A weary lot
is that of hopeless poverty, when it relies on charity
alone for food and warmth and raiment; but wearier
still is the lot of those, who, amid privation and
want, still struggle to keep themselves from the
deep abyss of beggary, and strive with decent pride
still to retain their foothold in a world which too
often confounds misfortune with disgrace. It was
amid cares, and troubles, and anxieties of every
kind that Fanny Wilbank grew up to womanhood.
To say that she was beautiful would convey but
little idea of the gentleness, the delicacy, the loveliness
of her countenance. I might describe her
soft black eyes, her full bright lips, the jetty
blackness of her luxuriant tresses, the grace of
her slender form, and the elastic spring of her
bounding step, but it would need the painter’s art
to image the tender sweetness of her expression.
Her face was such as one might fancy for a
Madonna—pale, pensive and full of high-souled
thought; but Fanny knew little of her beauty and
cared less. Had she possessed the talisman of
wealth she might have been the artist’s model and
the poet’s theme; but the spell of beauty alone is
powerless to unlock the treasures of earth, and
Fanny was too poor to behold her own charms in
the magic mirror of flattery. Indeed she never
seemed to think of herself; she managed for every
body, ministered to the comfort of every body, and
took her share of enjoyment in beholding the
gratification of others. But it must not be supposed
that her beauty and goodness were unknown
and unappreciated. Several unexceptionable offers
of marriage were made to her—offers, which if
accepted, would have placed her far beyond the
reach of want and labor—but Fanny was not to
be influenced by sordid motives in so momentous
a matter, and resisting all the temptations of a life
of ease, still preserved her quiet cheerfulness to
illumine the home of her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her hour of severer trial, however, came at last.
Among the few companions of her childhood was
a youth of humble fortunes but of noble character,
whose name I shall conceal under that of William
Grey. Their regard for each other had grown up
so gradually in their hearts, probably neither was
aware of its strength, until the time when William
was to go out into the world and strive amid his
fellows to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.
The grief which each felt at this separation, revealed
the nature of their feelings, and Fanny wondered at
herself when she found how closely her love for a
stranger had entwined itself with the affections
which she had hitherto devoted to the claims of
kindred. But they plighted faith to each other, and
looking forward to a future of mutual love and
quiet happiness, William obeyed the call of duty,
while the gentle Fanny continued to pursue her
routine of heavy cares with a cheerful and hopeful
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After an absence of two years, William full of
eager anticipation returned to claim the fulfilment
of her pledge, and to bear her to a humble home in
another part of the country. Fanny’s heart misgave
her sadly, when she looked on her pale mother
and thought of the burden which would fall upon
her when she was gone. She half repented of her
promise to William, dearly as she loved him, for
she had so long been accustomed to think of the
comfort of others, in preference to her own, that
self gratification seemed to her almost a sin. But
her scruples were soon put to rest, for her parents,
unwilling to make any sacrifices on their part for
their self-denying child, positively refused to listen
to her lover’s suit. Nay, they even accused Fanny
of selfishness, and made out a charge of black
ingratitude against her, for wishing to leave them.
With the usual impatience of man’s temper, William
was deeply incensed at such treatment, and endeavored
to persuade Fanny to a clandestine marriage.
Her answer to his proposal was one which might
be remembered with profit by those who rush heedlessly
to the altar, even when their path lies over
the crushed hearts of those who watched their
helpless infancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How could I hope to perform my duties to you,
William,’ said she, ‘if I came to you with the
curse of a broken commandment clinging to me?
Think you a disobedient child could prove a good
wife? No, dearly as you now love me, you would
be the first to doubt me, were I to give you such a
proof of my selfish disregard to the ties of blood.
We are both young yet, let us then wait until the
future shall bring us better prospects.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘God knows, Fanny, I would serve for you even
as Jacob did for Rachel, could I but hope to see you
my own, but I know not how time is to remove the
obstacles which divide us,’ was his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, Mary will soon be old enough to fill my
place, and then I can be spared from home,’
said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Alas if I am to wait till your place can be
supplied by another, I shall but live on hope to die
in despair,’ said William despondingly; ‘no one can
ever be the same, thoughtful, patient, affectionate,
ministering angel that you have been to all around
you.’ And thus they again parted, but which think
you suffered most keenly from this disappointment?
Was it he whose love was but the episode in the
striving tale of life—who listened to the voice of
affection, but as soft music played between the acts
of the great tragi-comedy of existence? No! the
shaft of pain sunk deepest in the heart of her who
remained in the seclusion of home, shut up within
the narrow circle of duties which daily, hourly
reminded her of the almost hopeless nature of her
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time sped on and brought its usual changes.
The boys grew old enough to be provided with
situations beyond the parental roof, and Fanny
began to look forward once more to a union with
her lover. But in the midst of her brightening
hopes, her mother died, leaving to Fanny as her
last bequest, the charge of watching over the youth
of her only sister. This sacred duty was one which
Fanny might easily have fulfilled without the sacrifice
of a single desire of her own heart, had not
Mary’s failing health rendered it a task of unceasing
anxiety. An accident received in infancy had
slowly and insidiously undermined the once vigorous
constitution of the child, and soon after the mother
was laid within the tomb, an incurable disease of
the spine confined Mary entirely to her bed. It
was then, with a heart bleeding over the severed
ties of kindred, that Fanny first taught herself to
reflect upon the necessity of a final sacrifice of her
hopes of happiness. Her father was fast sinking
under the infirmities of age, and Mary was now
helplessly dependent on her for every comfort; how
then could she indulge the vain dream of being able
to study her own welfare. There was a bitter
struggle in the heart of the poor girl ere she could
bring herself to write a letter of renunciation to
William. But she swerved not her duty, however
severe might be its requisitions, and while the
tears fell like rain over the thoughts of her blighted
hopes, not one drop was allowed to blister the
page which bore him her final farewell. But Fanny
was sadly mistaken when she fancied that the
severest part of the conflict was past. The letter
only served to bring William in person to combat
the resolution she had formed, and she was now
to endure the redoubled anguish of beholding her
lover’s sorrow. But in vain he sought to alter her
decision. She knew that instead of being a help-meet,
she could now be only a hindrance to one
who was obliged to labor for his daily bread, and
her unselfish love taught her that it was for her</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Alone to suffer and alone to strive.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My fate is fixed, William,’ said the hopeless
girl; ‘I cannot perform the duties of a poor man’s
wife, without neglecting my afflicted sister; her
sufferings would mar your daily comfort, and her
necessities demand my undivided attention. God
knows how tenderly I have loved you, and how
gratefully I feel your faithfulness, in thus abiding
constant through years of absence and disappointment,
but that must be at an end now, William;—our
long engagement must be forgotten,—you are
free—and may heaven grant you a happier destiny
than to be linked with one who seems born only
for sorrow.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Fanny! how bitterly she wept as she uttered
these words of self-immolation! But she knew she
was right, and even William, when the first burst of
grief had subsided, and he was able to reflect calmly
upon all the circumstances, acknowledged within
himself, that Fanny had judged wisely for both.
He could appreciate the honest pride which forbade
her to fill a husband’s home with her own helpless
relatives, and he could well understand the disinterested
affection which taught her to make her own
heart the victim rather than heap heavier burdens upon
one with whom the world had already dealt hardly.
Again they parted, but no hope of reunion now
cheered their last farewell;—henceforth they were
to meet as friends, but never more to exchange the
sweet tones of lovers’ vows. How much less heroism
is required to perform noble deeds in the sight,
and beneath the applause of thousands, than thus to
sacrifice love, and hope, and happiness, in silence
and secrecy on the altar of duty! Yet the warrior
receives his meed of glory, while the woman who
calmly surrenders the ‘life of life’ without the stimulus
of fame or the hope of guerdon;—she who
patiently lives on, ‘in helpless, hopeless, brokenness
of heart,’ ministering meekly to others, while a
wasting grief is eating into her very soul—goes
down to the grave unnoticed and unknown—perhaps
regarded as a cold and eccentric being by those
who cannot fathom the pure depths of such a mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny’s cheek grew pale and hollow, but she
gave no other evidence of secret sorrow, for she
well knew that Mary’s keen eye would watch for
traces of her heart’s struggle, and she would not
pain her suffering sister by a knowledge of the bitter
price at which her comfort had been purchased. At
length she heard of William’s marriage, and this
severed the last frail link that bound their hearts
together. From that time his name was never
mentioned, and resolutely forbidding her thoughts to
dwell upon the past, Fanny Wilbank compelled herself
to cheerfulness. But a shadow had gone over
her bright face, and her voice learned a new tone of
melancholy pathos—<span class='it'>she spoke like one who often
weeps</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The death of her father soon after left her alone
with her helpless sister, and having a small apartment,
Fanny now commenced the task of obtaining
a livelihood for both by the labors of her needle.
The constant attention which Mary required, rendered
this very difficult, for many an hour which
should have been employed in earning their daily
bread, was spent in soothing the pangs of the
afflicted invalid. It was at that period that I first
met with this heroine of humble life, for what I have
hitherto been telling you I learned long afterward.
My mother had occasion to employ a sempstress,
and Fanny Wilbank having been recommended to
her, I was sent to make some enquiry of her
previous to giving her the work. I was a giddy
school-girl at the time, but I shall never forget the
impression made upon me by the neatness of the
apartment, the snowy whiteness of the bed-linen,
and above all, by the extreme beauty of both the
females. Mary’s disease did not in the least impair
the bloom of her lovely countenance, and as
she sat propped up in bed by pillows, she looked in
far better health than her pale sister. But I soon
found that her face was the only part of her frame
which had escaped the distorting touch of pain, for
her body was shrunken to the size of that of a
child, and her limbs were sadly mis-shapen. My
business with them was soon settled, but the interest
which they had awakened in my bosom did not so
quickly subside. My mother became one of their
warmest patrons, and having heard their history
from one of their early friends, I need scarcely add
that we felt increased respect and regard for the
self-devoted Fanny Wilbank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did she meet with no reward for all her
virtues, cousin Grace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! Frank, it is only in novels I fear, that
we find virtue always rewarded and vice signally
punished. Such things are rarely recompensed on
earth, it is only in Heaven that we are told ‘all
tears shall be wiped away.’ But I have not yet
finished my story. Medical skill was procured for
Mary, which, though it could not cure a disease
ingrafted in her whole system, yet afforded some
alleviation of her severest sufferings. Constant employment
was also secured to Fanny, so that as far
as pecuniary matters went, their condition was
much improved; but no human hand could bring
back health to the one, or restore the blighted
blossoms of hope in the bosom of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some few years later I married, and accompanied
my husband to Europe, and my parents having
about the same time removed to the south, I lost
sight of Fanny Wilbank. When, however, after
some years absence I returned to my native city,
one of my first wishes was to learn something of
her present condition. But the friends who had
promised to employ her, had neglected to do so
until it was too late; all trace of her had vanished,
and I was left to conjecture her fate. I was one
day passing a handsome house in —— street, when
I heard a voice from an upper window exclaim
‘Mrs. ——! I am sure it is Mrs. ——!’ I looked
up in surprise and beheld Fanny Wilbank. The
next moment the hall door opened, and Fanny
hurrying down the steps, grasped my hand with the
warmth of earnest affection. I followed her into a
neatly furnished room, and mechanically seating
myself, wondered what it all meant. Fanny divined
my thoughts, for she smiled, blushed, and seemed
about to tell me some news, when a little chubby
boy, of some three summers, twaddled into the room
and saluted her by the appellation of ‘mother.’
This solved the whole mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come into the next room, where you will
find Mary,’ said Fanny, ‘and I will tell you all
about it. For you really did not know that I was
married?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No indeed,’ was my reply, ‘pray how long
have you been a wife?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Almost a year.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Almost a year?’ I exclaimed in stupid wonder!
‘and that child?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Is my husband’s youngest boy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then you married to take care of another’s
children.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, I could not refuse him,—fortune had
prospered him, so that he could afford to take care
of poor Mary, and I consented, though I was almost
ashamed to become a bride at my age.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘At your age! why you look younger and prettier
than ever, Fanny, in that tasteful little cap.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Do not laugh at me, dear Mrs. ——, I know
it was foolish to marry for love at forty-five, but
William was so lonely, and his poor children were
so desolate.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then it was William Grey you married?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To be sure;—<span class='it'>did you think it could be any
one else?</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ah!’ said Mary smiling, ‘William would not
have won her even now, if it had not been for his
motherless children. Fanny has been so long accustomed
to sacrifice her own inclinations, that she cannot
be persuaded to any self-indulgence unless some
duty be closely connected with it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny Wilbank still lives; the beauty of her noble
countenance has faded beneath the touch of time,
and many a thread of silver is mingled with her
dark locks, yet is she the centre of a circle of loving
and beloved friends, still the same, patient, tender,
self-forgetting being, that she was in the day of her
early adversity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she was at last rewarded, cousin Grace, notwithstanding
your assertion to the contrary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you deem her after fortunes a fitting
recompense for the trials of her youth, Frank?
The bloom of youth, the freshness of feeling, the
glow of hope, the buoyancy of health,—all things
that give a charm to life, faded one by one from her
view, even as the stars vanish in the slowly-gathering
tempest cloud,—patience, long suffering, meekness,
and resignation had taken the place of bright
anticipation in her bereaved heart,—time had laid
his cold touch upon her fair brow, aye, and upon
her warm heart too, and then, at the last she was
<span class='it'>rewarded</span>—how?—why forsooth, by wedding the
object of her early love, after her life had ‘fallen
into the sear and yellow leaf,’—and thus obtaining
the enviable privilege of educating the children of
her predecessor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of poor Mary, cousin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not remember, Frank, the sick lady on
whose bed you loved to clamber, when you were
a merry little urchin, who used to cover your balls
so neatly, and paint so many pretty devices for your
kites?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I do;—I remember too how bitterly
I cried when they told me she was dead, and I saw
them bring in the small coffin for her shrunken form.
You don’t mean to say that was Mary Wilbank?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was, cousin Frank, and in the story of Fanny
Wilbank, I have been relating to you the early life
of one whom you have ever loved with filial tenderness—I
mean your excellent step-mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is the only mother I have ever known,
cousin Grace, and you can tell me nothing good
of her which I cannot readily believe; so if you take
her for an example, I have no more to say against
the existence of disinterestedness in this selfish
world. It is only a pity there are so few like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the beautiful season of youth, when life is
just budding forth in all the dewy freshness of
ardent hope; when the heart is buoyant, and the
energies alive, and panting after objects around
which to shed the virtuous influence of their association,
oh! then it is that we feel, like the harp
that is delicately attuned, the full force of every
impression:—of what moment, therefore, are those
early connections and restraints which are voluntarily
assumed to fit us for our companionship with
the world, or in other words to form the character
by which we are to be known and appreciated
among our fellow men; but that character when
formed, like the vestal fire of the ancients, demands
the constant vigilance of our noblest faculties to
keep alive and perpetuate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George Morris was in his twenty-fourth year,
when partly by the intercession of rich relatives,
and in a great measure by the possession of personal
endowments of no ordinary kind, he was
called upon to assume an office of public trust.
I knew him well. Gay without frivolity—proud
in the consciousness of correct principle, and gifted
with enviable powers of pleasing, his career, indeed,
seemed to offer the rich rewards, if not of honorable
fame, at least of high respectability. He loved,
and after a short courtship, was wedded. Never
were two hearts more willingly allied. The whole
ardor of his soul was devoted to the fair being
whom he had chosen for his own, and in the
retirement of his home did he acknowledge his
earthly happiness. Did reflection dwell on the
noise and bustle of the world without, it was only
to assure him of the comforts of his peaceful fire-side.
Thus did time glide on with silken wing,
dispensing the calm and rational pleasures of domestic
life, which Morris of all others was so
formed to appreciate. He began his career, which
it was foretold would be so honorable to him, in
the capacity of one of the chief officers of an institution
of public monetary trust. Here, with principles
of integrity, deep rooted as the rock, he
persevered in industrious habits, and by continued
vigilance deservedly won the esteem of the community.
His probity had been tested, and the man
of business implicitly confided in him. Society
courted him. Living in a populous city, as years
progressed, he occupied an advanced position
among his fellow men—honorable alike to himself
and to a growing family: no cares had with him
an abiding place, for his children, whom he dearly
loved, were gladdening the father’s heart, and
yielding him bright hopes for the future. All
was happiness—all love and tranquillity. Who
then would venture to disturb this domestic Eden?
What baneful influence could bring desolation
here? Who could wring the tear of anguish from
that young and doating mother—or the helping
cry from that unprotected child—who convert, as
with magic wand, the happy homestead into the
refuge of want and affliction? The husband! the
father himself! Mystery of mysteries! yet did
Morris work to himself this very ruin. Lured by
the expensive fashions of the day, the splendid
equipage, and the gay coterie of wealth, and desirous
to equal, if not eclipse the brilliance which he
saw in the circles wherein he was called to move,
he had given the rein to his appetite and ambition,
until he was forced to do an act—an act from
which he once would have shrunk aghast, with
horror and dismay. He defrauded, and was detected—he
fled: but could he avoid himself?
Could he escape the guilty conscience—the bitter
remorse? It was in vain. Go where he would,
fancy would revert to that blighted, ruined home;
and the thought of that one withering act—it
was insupportable—it was madness. His reputation
was irrecoverably gone, and he roamed
abroad far from his native land—a wandering
outcast. Of what avail were now to him the
common blessings of nature? the light to him was
as the darkness—the very air was heavy, and
laden as with the vapors of a dungeon—the
world itself was one vast prison-house. Did he
sleep—frightful phantoms would haunt his couch,
and drive away repose; supplicating hands of beggared
orphans and stricken widows would rise in
airy forms, while strange, unearthly voices would
cry aloud, and pierce the air in wail and lamentation,
then die away as if in mock and derision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afar from country, relatives and friends, lived
the Defaulter. Bitter was the cup which that man
drained to the very dregs. Providence had set its
sure seal of condemnation on his destiny, and although
the laws of man were impotent, the great
law of the Omniscient failed not. There was no
retreat from that <span class='it'>presence</span>, which hath so solemnly
declared “thou shalt not steal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length news was brought to him from afar—it
told him that the wife of his bosom was dead—his
children dependant upon the charity of strangers.
It was upon the receipt of this intelligence
that I met Morris, who was dwelling in a retired
part of one of the chief cities upon the Continent.
I dared not think upon what might be the probable
result of my interview. Conflicting emotions were
agitating my breast, but I had fully resolved on the
meeting, and on my arrival accordingly, sought out
his residence. It was about eight o’clock, of a
summer’s night, that, in an abstracted mood, I
sauntered leisurely toward the house. Having presented
myself, I was admitted to a small chamber,
neatly furnished, where I found him alone. I
knew not how to begin, how to address myself to
my early friend—so altered. He was lying on a
couch, evidently in the last stage of a fever. You
felt at once he was a dying man. His presence
bewildered me; the hollow and glassy eye riveted
my gaze, until recollecting myself, in a subdued
tone I spoke of the country I had left—my object
in travelling—my desire to obtain tidings of himself;
and then ventured to recall his memory to
the many happy days we had spent in each other’s
society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone, gone!” said he, groaning aloud, and
seeming to awaken from a listless reverie. In a
moment he continued. “Will not one human
creature compassionate George Morris?—a stranger
in a strange land! My Julia—my wife—the
mother of my little ones, they tell me is dead; and
I, who loved her so, poor thing, they say was her
destroyer. Oh, God! have mercy on thy creature, I
feel thy indignation, and am smitten in the dust.
Come death, come the grave—welcome your embraces!
But I cannot—cannot endure the iron
that is now thrusting itself in my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something grand and terrible in the
moral subjugation of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“L——,” he faintly articulated, after a pause,
during which he wept—yes, wept for the first and
<span class='it'>last</span> time, “I feel that I am dying—thank God!
for his mercy; forgive, my friend, the weakness of
these tears—they are of contrition—of—of penitence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exhausted by this effort, he sank into my arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“L——,” continued he, reviving, and raising
his voice—“do you not see her—there L——,
there she is, she’s beckoning to me—she looks
the same as on that bridal night—she smiles, too,
upon me—and look, L——, look, she forgives
me—I come! we were sundered once, but now
they cannot disunite us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A struggle ensued, but it was short; a moment
more, and he was <span class='it'>dead</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flickering flame of the taper had gone out;
the moonlight rested upon the pale features of the
corpse; and the soul of the Defaulter had sped to
its eternal reckoning.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is not improbable that a few farther steps in
phrenological science will lead to a belief in the
existence, if not to the actual discovery and location
of an organ of <span class='it'>analysis</span>. If this power (which
may be described, although not defined, as the
capacity for resolving thought into its elements) be
not, in fact, an essential portion of what late philosophers
term ideality, then there are indeed many,
good reasons for supposing it a primitive faculty.
That it may be a constituent of ideality is here suggested
in opposition to the vulgar dictum (founded,
however, upon the assumptions of grave authority,)
that the calculating and discriminating powers
(causality and comparison) are at variance with
the imaginative—that the three, in short, can
hardly coexist. But, although thus opposed to
received opinion, the idea will not appear ill-founded
when we observe that the processes of
invention or creation are strictly akin with the
processes of resolution—the former being nearly,
if not absolutely, the latter conversed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot be doubted that the mental features
discoursed of as the analytical are, in themselves,
but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate
them only in their effects. We know of them,
among other things, that they are always to their
possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of
the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults
in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises
as call his muscles into action, so glories the
analyst in that moral activity which <span class='it'>disentangles</span>.
He derives pleasure from even the most trivial
occupations bringing his talent into play. He is
fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics—exhibiting
in his solutions of each and all a degree
of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension
preternatural. His results, brought about by
the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth,
the whole air of intuition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faculty in question is possibly much invigorated
by mathematical study, and especially by that
highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely
on account of its retrogade operations, has been
called, as if <span class='it'>par excellence</span>, analysis. Yet to calculate
is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player,
for example, does the one without effort at the
other. It follows that the game of chess, in its
effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood.
I am not now writing a treatise, but simply
prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations
very much at random—I will, therefore,
take occasion to assert that the higher powers
of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and
more usefully taxed by the unostentatious game of
draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.
In this latter, where the pieces have different and
bizarre motions, with various and variable values,
that which is only complex is mistaken (a not
unusual error) for that which is profound. The
<span class='it'>attention</span> is here called powerfully into play. If it
flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting
in injury or defeat. The possible moves
being not only manifold but involute, the chances
of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases
out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than
the more acute player who conquers. In draughts,
on the contrary, where the moves are unique and
have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence
are diminished, and the mere attention
being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages
are obtained by either party are obtained by
superior acumen. To be less abstract. Let us
suppose a game of draughts, where the pieces are
reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no
oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that
here the victory can be decided (the players being
at all equal) only by some recherché movement,
the result of some strong exertion of the intellect.
Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws
himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies
himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus,
at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed
absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into
miscalculation or hurry into error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whist has long been noted for its influence upon
what are termed the calculating powers; and men
of the highest order of intellect have been known
to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it,
while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt
there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking
the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player
in Christendom <span class='it'>may</span> be little more than the best
player of chess—but proficiency in whist implies
capacity for success in all those more important
undertakings where mind struggles with mind.
When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in
the game which includes a comprehension of all
the sources (whatever be their character) from
which legitimate advantage may be derived. These
are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently
among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible
to the ordinary understanding. To observe
attentively is to remember distinctly; and so far
the concentrative chess-player will do very well at
whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based
upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently
and generally comprehensible. Thus to
have a retentive memory, and to proceed by “the
book,” are points commonly regarded as the sum
total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond
the limits of mere rule where the skill of the
analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host
of observations and inferences. So perhaps do his
companions; and the difference in the extent of the
information obtained lies not so much in the falsity
of the inference as in the quality of the observation.
The necessary knowledge is that of <span class='it'>what</span> to observe.
Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because
the game is the object, does he reject deductions
from things external to the game. He examines
the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully
with that of each of his opponents. He considers
the mode of assorting the cards in each
hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor
by honor, through the glances bestowed by their
holders upon each. He notes every variation of
face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of
thought from the differences in the expression of
certainty, of surprise, of triumph or of chagrin.
From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges
whether the person taking it can make another in
the suit. He recognises what is played through
feint by the air with which it is thrown upon the
table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental
dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying
anxiety or carelessness in regard to its
concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the
order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation,
eagerness or trepidation—all afford to his
apparently intuitive perception indications of the
true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds
having been played, he is in full possession of the
contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts
down his cards with as absolute a precision of
purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward
the faces of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The analytical power should not be confounded
with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is
necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often
utterly incapable of analysis. I have spoken of
this latter faculty as that of resolving thought into
its elements, and it is only necessary to glance
upon this idea to perceive the necessity of the
distinction just mentioned. The constructive or
combining power, by which ingenuity is usually
manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe
erroneously) have assigned a separate organ,
supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently
seen in those whose intellect bordered
otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted general
observation among writers on morals. Between
ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a
difference far greater indeed than that between the
fancy and the imagination, but of a character very
strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that
the ingenious are always fanciful, and the <span class='it'>truly</span>
imaginative never otherwise than profoundly analytic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrative which follows will appear to the
reader somewhat in the light of a commentary
upon the propositions just advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Residing in Paris during the spring and part of
the summer of 18—, I there contracted an intimacy
with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young
gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of an illustrious
family, but, by a variety of untoward events,
had been reduced to such poverty that the quondam
energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and
he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care
for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of
his creditors there still remained in his possession
a small remnant of his patrimony; and upon the
income arising from this he managed, by means of
a vigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of
life, without troubling himself about its superfluities.
Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris
these are easily obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our first meeting was at an obscure library in
the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our
both being in search of the same very rare and
very remarkable volume brought us into closer
communion. We saw each other again and again.
I was deeply interested in the little family history
which he detailed to me with all the candor which
a Frenchman indulges only when self is his theme.
I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his
reading—and above all I felt my soul enkindled
within me by the wild fervor, and what I could
only term the vivid freshness, of his imagination.
Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt
that the society of such a man would be to me a
treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly
confided to him. It was at length arranged that
we should live together during my stay in the city;
and, as my worldly circumstances were somewhat
less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to
be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a
style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our
common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion,
long deserted through superstitions into which
we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a
retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St.
Germain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the routine of our life at this place been
known to the world, we should have been regarded
as madmen—although, perhaps, as madmen of a
harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We
admitted no visiters whomsoever. Indeed the locality
of our retirement had been carefully kept a
secret from my own former associates; and it had
been many years since Dupin had ceased to know
or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what
else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the Night
for her own sake; and into this <span class='it'>bizarrerie</span>, as into
all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to
his wild whims with an utter <span class='it'>abandon</span>. The sable
divinity would not herself dwell with us always,
but we could counterfeit her presence. At the
first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy
shutters of our old building, lighting a couple of
tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the
ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these
we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing,
or conversing, until warned by the clock of
the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied
forth into the streets, arm in arm, continuing the
topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a
late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows
of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement
which quiet observation would afford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At such times I could not help remarking and
admiring (although from his rich ideality I had
been prepared to expect) a peculiar analytic ability
in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight
in its exercise, if not exactly in its display;
and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus
derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling
laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore
windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow
up such assertions by direct and very startling
proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His
manner at these moments was frigid and abstract;
his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice,
usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would
have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness
and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing
him in these moods I often dwelt meditatively
upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and
amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the
creative and the resolvent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let it not be supposed, from what I have just
said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning
any romance. What I have described in the
Frenchman was but the result of an excited, or
perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the
character of his remarks at the periods in question
an example will best convey the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were strolling one night down a long dirty
street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being
both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of
us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at
least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these
words—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and
would do better for the <span class='it'>Théâtre des Variétés</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied
unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much
had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary
manner in which the speaker had chimed in with
my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected
myself, and my astonishment was profound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my
comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I
am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses.
How was it possible you should know I was
thinking of ——?” Here I paused, to ascertain
beyond a doubt whether he really knew of
whom I thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>——“of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you
pause? You were remarking to yourself that his
diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was precisely what had formed the subject
of my reflections. Chantilly was a quondam cobbler
of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad,
had attempted the role of Xerxes, in Crebillon’s
tragedy so called, and been notoriously pasquinaded
for his pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, for God’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the
method—if method there be—by which you have
been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.”
In fact I was even more startled than I would
have been willing to express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who
brought you to the conclusion that the mender of
soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes <span class='it'>et id
genus omne</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no
fruiterer whomsoever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who ran up against you as we entered
the street—it may have been fifteen minutes
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now remembered that in fact a fruiterer, carrying
upon his head a large basket of apples, had
nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed
from the Rue C—— into the thoroughfare where
we now stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly
I could not possibly understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a particle of <span class='it'>charlatânerie</span> about
Dupin. “I will explain,” he said, “and that you
may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace
the course of your meditations, from the moment
in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre
with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of
the chain run thus—Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichol,
Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are few persons who have not, at some
period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing
the steps by which particular conclusions of
their own minds have been attained. The occupation
is often full of interest; and he who attempts
it for the first time is astonished by the apparently
illimitable distance and incoherence between the
starting-point and the goal. What then, must have
been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman
speak what he had just spoken, and when I could
not help acknowledging that he had spoken the
truth. He continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had been talking of horses, if I remember
aright, just before leaving the Rue C——. This
was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed
into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon
his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon
a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where
the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped
upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly
strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered
a few words, turned to look at the pile, and
then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly
attentive to what you did—but observation has
become with me of late a species of necessity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing
with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts in
the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking
of the stones) until we reached the little alley called
Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment,
with the overlapping and riveted blocks.
Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving
your lips move, I could not doubt that you
murmured to yourself the word ‘stereotomic.’ You
continued the same inaudible murmur, with a knit
brow, as is the custom of a man tasking his
memory, until I considered that you sought the
Greek derivation of the word ‘stereotomy.’ I knew
that you could not find this without being brought
to think of atomics, and thus of the theories of
Epicurus; and as, when we discussed this subject
not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly,
yet with how little notice, the vague guesses
of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in
the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could
not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great
nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you
would do so. You did look up; and I now was
assured that I had correctly followed your steps.
But in that bitter <span class='it'>tirade</span> upon Chantilly, which appeared
in yesterday’s ‘<span class='it'>Musée</span>,’ the satirist, making
some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler’s change of
name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a very
peculiar Latin line upon whose meaning we have
often conversed. I mean the line</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I had told you that this was in reference to Orion,
formerly written Urion; and from certain pungencies
connected with this explanation I was aware
that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear,
therefore, that you would not fail to combine the
two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did
combine them I saw by the character of the smile
which passed over your lips. You thought of the
poor cobbler’s immolation. So far, you had been
stooping in your gait—but now I saw you draw
yourself up to your full height. I was then sure
that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of
Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations
to remark that as in fact he <span class='it'>was</span> a very
little fellow—that Chantilly—he would do better
at the <span class='it'>Théâtre des Variétés</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long after this we were looking over an
evening edition of “Le Tribunal,” when the following
paragraphs arrested our attention.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Extraordinary Murders.</span>—This morning,
about three o’clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier
St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession
of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the
fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known
to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L’Espanaye,
and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille
L’Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by a
fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual
manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar,
and eight or ten of the neighbors entered,
accompanied by two <span class='it'>gendarmes</span>. By this time the
cries had ceased; but as the party rushed up the
first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in
angry contention were distinguished, and seemed
to proceed from the upper part of the house. As
the second landing was reached, these sounds, also,
had ceased, and every thing remained perfectly quiet.
The party spread themselves, and hurried from room
to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber
in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found
locked, with the key inside, was forced open) a
spectacle presented itself which struck every one
present not less with horror than with astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the
furniture broken and thrown about in all directions.
There was only one bedstead; and from this the
bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle
of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared
with blood. On the hearth were two or three long
and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled
in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by
the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons,
an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons,
three smaller of <span class='it'>metal d’Alger</span>, and two bags, containing
nearly four thousand francs in gold. The
drawers of a <span class='it'>bureau</span>, which stood in one corner,
were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although
many articles still remained in them. A
small iron safe was discovered under the <span class='it'>bed</span> (not
under the bedstead.) It was open, with the key still
in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old
letters, and other papers of little consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here
seen; but, an unusual quantity of soot being observed
in the fire-place, a search was made in the
chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of
the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom;
it having been thus forced up the narrow
aperture for a considerable distance. The body
was quite warm. Upon examining it many excoriations
were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the
violence with which it had been thrust up and
disengaged. Upon the face were many severe
scratches, and upon the throat dark bruises, and
deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased
had been throttled to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a thorough investigation of every portion
of the house, without farther discovery, the party
made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of
the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady,
with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt
to raise her, the head fell off, and rolled to some
distance. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully
mutilated—the former so much so as scarcely
to retain any semblance of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we
believe, the slightest clew.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day’s paper had these additional particulars.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.</span> Many individuals
have been examined in relation to this
most extraordinary and frightful affair.” [The
word ‘<span class='it'>affaire</span>’ has not yet, in France, that levity
of import which it conveys with us,] “but nothing
whatever has transpired to throw light upon it.
We give below all the material testimony elicited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pauline Dubourg</span>, laundress, deposes that she
has known both the deceased for three years,
having washed for them during that period. The
old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very
affectionate toward each other. They were
excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their
mode or means of living. Believed that Madame
L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have
money put by. Never met any persons in the house
when she called for the clothes or took them home.
Was sure that they had no servant in employ.
There appeared to be no furniture in any part of
the building except in the fourth story.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pierre Moreau</span>, tobacconist, deposes that he has
been in the habit of selling small quantities of
tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for
nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood,
and has always resided there. The deceased and
her daughter had occupied the house in which the
corpses were found for more than six years. It
was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let
the upper rooms to various persons. The house
was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied
with the abuse of the premises by her
tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let
any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness
had seen the daughter some five or six times during
the six years. The two lived an exceedingly
retired life—were reputed to have money. Had
heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L.
told fortunes—did not believe it. Had never seen
any person enter the door except the old lady and
her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician
some eight or ten times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to
the same effect. No one was spoken of as frequenting
the house. It was not known whether there
were any living connexions of Madame L. and her
daughter. The shutters of the front windows were
seldom opened. Those in the rear were always
closed, with the exception of the large back room,
fourth story. The house was a good house—not
very old.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Isidore Musèt</span>, gendarme, deposes that he was
called to the house about three o’clock in the morning,
and found some twenty or thirty persons at the
gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced
it open, at length with a bayonet—not with a crowbar.
Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on
account of its being a double or folding gate, and
bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks
were continued until the gate was forced—and then
suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of
some person (or persons) in great agony—were
loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness
led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first
landing heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the
one a gruff voice, the other much shriller—a
very strange voice. Could distinguish some
words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman.
Was positive that it was not a woman’s
voice. Could distinguish the words ‘<span class='it'>sacré</span>’ and
‘<span class='it'>diable</span>.’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.
Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a
man or of a woman. Could not make out what
was said, but believed the language to be Spanish.
The state of the room and of the bodies was
described by this witness as we described them
yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Henri Duval</span>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith,
deposes that he was one of the party who
first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony
of Musèt in general. As soon as they forced an
entrance, they reclosed the door to keep out the
crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding
the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this
witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain
it was not French. Could not be sure that it was
a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s.
Was not acquainted with the Italian language.
Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced
by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian.
Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed
with both frequently. Was sure that the
shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—— <span class='it'>Odenheimer</span>, restaurateur. This witness
volunteered his testimony. Not speaking French
was examined through an interpreter. Is a native
of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time
of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes—probably
ten. They were long and loud—very
awful and distressing. Was one of those who
entered the building. Corroborated the previous
evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that
the shrill voice was that of a man—of a Frenchman.
Could not distinguish the words uttered.
They were loud and quick—unequal—sometimes
quick, sometimes deliberate—spoken apparently in
fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh—not
so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a
shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly ‘<span class='it'>sacré</span>,’
‘<span class='it'>diable</span>,’ and once ‘<span class='it'>mon dieu</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Jules Mignaud</span>, Banker, of the firm of Mignaud
et Fils, Rue Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud.
Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had
opened an account with his banking house in the
spring of the year —— (eight years previously.)
Made frequent deposites in small sums. Had
checked for nothing until the third day before her
death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000
francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk sent
home with the money.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Adolphe Le Bon</span>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils,
deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he
accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence
with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon
the door being opened Mademoiselle L. appeared
and took from his hands one of the bags, while the
old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed
and departed. Did not see any person in the street
at the time. It is a bye street—very lonely.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>William Bird</span>, tailor, deposes that he was one of
the party who entered the house. Is an Englishman.
Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of
the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in
contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.
Could make out several words, but cannot
now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘<span class='it'>sacré</span>’ and
‘<span class='it'>mon dieu</span>.’ There was a sound at the moment
as if of several persons struggling—a scraping and
scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud—louder
than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not
the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that
of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice.
Does not understand German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled,
deposed that the door of the chamber in which was
found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on
the inside when the party reached it. Every thing
was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any
kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen.
The windows both of the back and front room
were down and firmly fastened from within. A
door between the two rooms was closed, but not
locked. The door leading from the front room
into the passage was locked with the key on the
inside. A small room in the front of the house, on
the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was
open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded
with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were
carefully removed and searched. There was not an
inch of any portion of the house which was not
carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and
down the chimneys. The house was a four story
one, with garrets, (<span class='it'>mansardes</span>). A trap door on
the roof was nailed down very securely—did not
appear to have been opened for years. The time
elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention
and the breaking open of the room door
was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made
it as short as three minutes—some as long as five.
The door was opened with difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Alfonzo Garcio</span>, undertaker, deposes that he
resides in the Rue Morgue. Is a native of Spain.
Was one of the party who entered the house. Did
not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive
of the consequences of agitation. Heard
the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that
of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was
said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman—is
sure of this. Does not understand the English
language, but judges by the intonation.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Alberto Montani</span>, confectioner, deposes that he
was among the first to ascend the stairs. Heard
the voices in question. The gruff voice was that
of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words.
The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could
not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke
quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a
Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is
an Italian. Never conversed with a native of
Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several witnesses recalled, here testified that the
chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were
too narrow to admit the passage of a human being.
By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes,
such as are employed by those who clean
chimneys. These brushes were passed up and
down every flue in the house. There is no back
passage by which any one could have descended
while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of
Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in
the chimney that it could not be got down until
four or five of the party united their strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Paul Dumas</span>, physician, deposes that he was
called to view the bodies about day-break. They
were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead
in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found.
The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and
excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up
the chimney would sufficiently account for these
appearances. The throat was greatly chafed.
There were several deep scratches just below the
chin, together with a series of livid spots which
were evidently the impression of fingers. The face
was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded.
The tongue had been partially bitten through. A
large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the
stomach, produced apparently by the pressure of a
knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle
L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by some
person or persons unknown. The corpse of the
mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of
the right leg and arm were more or less shattered.
The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the
ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised
and discolored. It was not possible to say how the
injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood,
or a broad bar of iron, a chair, any large heavy and
obtuse weapon, would have produced such results,
if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man.
No woman could have inflicted the blows with any
weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by
witness, was entirely separated from the body, and
was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently
been cut with some very sharp instrument—probably
with a razor.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Alexandre Etienne</span>, surgeon, was called with M.
Dumas to view the bodies. Corroborated the testimony,
and the opinions, of M. Dumas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing farther of importance was elicited,
although several other persons were examined. A
murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its
particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if
indeed a murder has been committed at all. The
police are entirely at fault—an unusual occurrence
in affairs of this nature. There is not, however,
the shadow of a clew apparent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The evening edition of the paper stated that the
greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St.
Roch—that the premises in question had been carefully
re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses
instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript,
however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been
arrested and imprisoned—although nothing appeared
to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress
of this affair—at least so I judged from his
manner, for he made no comments whatever. It
was only after the announcement that Le Bon had
been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion
respecting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could merely agree with all Paris in considering
it an insoluble mystery. I saw no means by
which it would be possible to trace the murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin,
“by this shell of an examination. The Parisian
police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning,
but no more. There is no method in their proceedings,
beyond the method of the moment. They
make a vast parade of measures; but not unfrequently
these are so illy adapted to the objects
proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur
Jourdain’s calling for his <span class='it'>robe-de-chambre—pour
mieux entendre la musique</span>. The results attained
by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the
most part, are brought about by simple diligence
and activity. When these qualities are unavailing
their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good
guesser, and a persevering man. But, without educated
thought, he erred continually by the very
intensity of his investigations. He impaired his
vision by holding the object too close. He might
see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness,
but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the
matter, as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as
being too profound. Truth is not always in a well.
In fact as regards the more important knowledge I
do believe that she is invariably superficial. The
depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not
upon the mountain tops where she is found. The
modes and sources of this kind of error are well
typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.
To look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long
way by turning toward it the exterior portions
of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions
of light than the interior) is to behold the star
distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its
lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion
as we turn our vision <span class='it'>fully</span> upon it. A greater
number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the
latter case, but in the former there is the more
refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity
we perplex and enfeeble thought—and it is
possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the
firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated,
and too direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for these murders, let us enter into some
examinations for ourselves, before we make up an
opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us
amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied,
but said nothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once
rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful.
We will go and see the premises with our
own eyes. I know G——, the <span class='it'>Préfet de Police</span>,
and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary
permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This permission was obtained, and we proceeded
at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those
miserable thoroughfares which intervene between
the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was
late in the afternoon when we reached it, for this
quarter is at a great distance from that in which
we resided. The house we readily found; for there
were still many persons gazing up at the closed
shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the
opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary
Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of
which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel
in the window, indicating a <span class='it'>loge de concierge</span>. Before
going in we walked up the street, turned down
an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear
of the building—Dupin, meanwhile, examining the
whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a
minuteness of attention for which I could see no
possible object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retracing our steps we came again to the front
of the dwelling, rang, and having shown our credentials,
were admitted by the agents in charge. We
went up stairs—into the chamber where the body
of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and
where both the deceased still lay. The disorders
of the room had as usual been suffered to exist.
I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the
“Tribunal.” Dupin scrutinized every thing, not
excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went
into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme
accompanying us throughout. Our examination
occupied us until dark, when we took our departure.
On our way home my companion stepped in for a
moment at the office of one of the daily papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said that the whims of my friend were
manifold, and that—<span class='it'>Je les menagais</span>:—for this
phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his
humor now to decline all conversation on the subject
of the murder, until after we had taken a bottle
of wine together about noon the next day. He
then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any
thing <span class='it'>peculiar</span> at the scene of the atrocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in his manner of emphasizing
the word “peculiar,” which caused me to
shudder, without knowing why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nothing <span class='it'>peculiar</span>,” I said, “nothing more,
at least, than we both saw stated in the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Le Tribunal,” he replied, “has not entered, I
fear, into the unusual horror of the thing. But we
will not revert to the idle opinions of this print. It
appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble,
for the very reason which should cause it to
be regarded as easy of solution—I mean for the
<span class='it'>outré</span> character of its features. The police are confounded
by the seeming absence of motive—not for
the murder itself—but for the atrocity of the murder.
They are puzzled by the seeming impossibility of
reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the
facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the
assassinated Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that
there were no means of egress without the notice
of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the
room; the corpse thrust with the head downward
up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body
of the old lady; these considerations, with those
just mentioned, and others which I need not mention,
have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting
completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the
government agents. They have fallen into the
gross but common error of confounding the unusual
with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from
the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way,
if at all, in its search after the true. In investigations
such as we are now pursuing, it should not
be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what
has occurred which has never occurred before.’ In
fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have
arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in exact
ratio with its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the
police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.
He continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking
toward the door of our apartment—“I am now
awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the
perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in
some measure implicated in their perpetration. Of
the worst portion of the crimes committed it is
probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am
right in this supposition; for upon it I build my
expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for
the man here—in this room—every moment. It
is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is
that he will. Should he come, it will be necessary
to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both
know how to use them when occasion demands
their use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did,
or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on,
very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already
spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His
discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice,
although by no means loud, had that intonation
which is commonly employed in speaking to some
one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in
expression, regarded only the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the voices heard in contention,” he said,
“by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices
of the women themselves, was fully proved by the
evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the
question whether the old lady could have first
destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed
suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the
sake of method; for the strength of Madame L’Espanaye
would have been utterly unequal to the task
of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney
as it was found; and the nature of the wounds
upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of
self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed
by some third party; and the voices of this third
party were those heard in contention. Let me
now advert—not to the whole testimony respecting
these voices—but to what was peculiar in that
testimony. Did you observe anything peculiar
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed
in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman,
there was much disagreement in regard to the
shrill, or as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but
it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You
have observed nothing distinctive. Re-employing
my own words, I may say that you have pointed
out no prominence above the plane of the ordinary,
by which reason may feel her way. Yet there <span class='it'>was</span>
something to be pointed out. The witnesses, as
you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they
were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill
voice the peculiarity is—not that they disagreed—but
that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard,
a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe
it, each one spoke of it as that <span class='it'>of a foreigner</span>.
Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his
own countrymen. Each likens it—not to the voice
of an individual of any nation with whose language
he is conversant—but the converse. The Frenchman
supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might
have distinguished some words <span class='it'>had he been acquainted
with the Spanish</span>.’ The Dutchman maintains
it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it
stated that ‘<span class='it'>not understanding French this witness
was examined through an interpreter</span>.’ The Englishman
thinks it the voice of a German, and
‘<span class='it'>does not understand German</span>.’ The Spaniard
‘is sure’ that it is that of an Englishman, but
‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘<span class='it'>as he has
no knowledge of the English</span>.’ The Italian believes
it the voice of a Russian, but ‘<span class='it'>has never conversed
with a native of Russia</span>.’ A second Frenchman
differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that
the voice is that of an Italian; but, <span class='it'>not being cognizant
of that tongue</span>, is like the Spaniard, ‘convinced
by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely unusual
must that voice have really been, about which such
testimony as this <span class='it'>could</span> have been elicited!—in
whose <span class='it'>tones</span>, even, denizens of the five great divisions
of Europe could recognise nothing familiar!
You will say that it might have been the voice of
an Asiatic—of an African. Neither Asiatics nor
Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the
inference, I will just now merely call your attention
to three points which have relation to this topic.
The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather
than shrill.’ It is represented by two others to
have been ‘quick and <span class='it'>unequal</span>.’ No words—no
sounds resembling words—were by any witness
mentioned as distinguishable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression
I may have made, so far, upon your own
understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that
legitimate deductions even from this portion of the
testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and
shrill voices—are in themselves sufficient to engender
a suspicion which should bias, or give direction
to all farther progress in the investigation of the
mystery. I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my
meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to
imply that the deductions were the <span class='it'>sole</span> proper ones,
and that the suspicion arose <span class='it'>inevitably</span> from them
as the single result. What the suspicion is, however,
I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to
bear in mind that with myself it was sufficiently
forcible to give a definite form—a certain tendency—to
my inquiries in the chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to
that chamber. What shall we first seek here? The
means of egress employed by the murderers. It is
not too much to say that we neither of us believe
in præternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle
L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The
doers of the dark deed were material, and escaped
materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but
one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that
mode <span class='it'>must</span> lead us to a definite decision. Let us
examine, each by each, the possible means of egress.
It is clear that the assassins were in the room
where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at
least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended
the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments
that we have to seek for issues. The police
have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the
masonry of the walls, in every direction. No <span class='it'>secret</span>
issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not
trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own.
There were, then, <span class='it'>no</span> secret issues. Both doors
leading from the rooms into the passage were
securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn
to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary
width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths,
will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of
a large cat. The impossibility of egress by means
already stated being thus absolute, we are reduced
to the windows. Through those of the front room
no one could have escaped without notice from the
crowd in the street. The murderers <span class='it'>must</span> have
passed, then, through those of the back room. Now,
brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a
manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners,
to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities.
It is only left for us to prove that these ‘impossibilities’
are not such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two windows in the chamber. One
of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly
visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden
from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead
which is thrust close up against it. The former
was found securely fastened from within. It resisted
the utmost force of those who endeavored to
raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in
its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found
fitted therein nearly to the head. Upon examining
the other window a similar nail was seen similarly
fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash
failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied
that egress had not been in these directions. And,
<span class='it'>therefore</span>, it was thought a matter of supererogation
to withdraw the nails and open the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own examination was somewhat more
particular, and was so for the reason I have just
given—because here it was, I knew, that all apparent
impossibilities <span class='it'>must</span> be proved to be not such
in reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I proceeded to think thus—<span class='it'>a posteriori</span>. The
murderers <span class='it'>did</span> escape from one of these windows.
This being so, they could not have re-fastened the
sashes from the inside as they were found fastened,—(the
consideration which put a stop, through its
obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this
quarter). Yet the sashes <span class='it'>were</span> fastened. They
<span class='it'>must</span>, then, have the power of fastening themselves.
There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped
to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail
with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the
sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated.
A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and
this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my
premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious
still appeared the circumstances attending the nails.
A careful search soon brought to light the hidden
spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery,
forbore to upraise the sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.
A person passing out through this window
might have reclosed it, and the spring would have
caught—but the nail could not have been replaced.
The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in
the field of my investigations. The assassins <span class='it'>must</span>
have escaped through the other window. Supposing,
then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as
was probable, there <span class='it'>must</span> be found a difference between
the nails, or at least between the modes of their
fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead,
I looked over the head-board minutely at the second
casement. Passing my hand down behind the board
I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which
was, as I had supposed, identical in character with
its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as
stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same
manner—driven in nearly up to the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will say that I was puzzled; but if you
think so you must have misunderstood the nature of
the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had
not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for
an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any
link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its
ultimate result—and that result was <span class='it'>the nail</span>. It
had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its
fellow in the other window; but this fact was an
absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be)
when compared with the consideration that here, at
this point, terminated the clew. ‘There <span class='it'>must</span> be
something wrong,’ I said, ‘about the nail.’ I
touched it; and the head, with about the eighth of
an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The
rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it
had been broken off. The fracture was an old one
(for its edges were incrusted with rust) and had apparently
been accomplished by the blow of a hammer,
which had partially imbedded in the top of the
bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now
carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation
whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to
a perfect nail was complete. I gently raised the sash
for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining
firm in its bed, I closed the window, and the
semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The
assassins had escaped through the window which
looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord
upon their exit (or perhaps purposely closed by
them) it had become fastened by the spring; and it
was the retention of this spring which had been
mistaken by the police for that of the nail—farther
inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next question is that of the mode of descent.
Upon this point I had been satisfied in my
walk with you around the building. About five
feet and a half from the casement in question there
ran a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have
been impossible for any one to reach the window
itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed,
however, that the shutters of the fourth story were
of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters
<span class='it'>ferrades</span>—a kind rarely employed at the present
day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at
Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are in the form of
an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door)
except that the lower half is latticed or worked in
open trellis—thus affording an excellent hold for
the hands. In the present instance these shutters
are fully three feet and a half broad. When we
saw them from the rear of the house, they were
both about half open—that is to say they stood off
at right angles from the wall. It is probable that
the police, as well as myself, examined the back of
the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these <span class='it'>ferrades</span>
in the line of their breadth, (as they must have
done) they did not perceive this great breadth itself,
or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration.
In fact, having once satisfied themselves
that no egress could have been made in this quarter,
they would naturally bestow here a very cursory
examination. It was clear to me, however, that the
shutter belonging to the window at the head of the
bed would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to
within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also
evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree
of activity and courage, an entrance into the window,
from the rod, might have been thus effected.
By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half
(we now suppose the shutter open to its whole
extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp
upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold
upon the rod, placing his feet firmly against the
wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have
swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine
the window open at the time, might even have
swung himself into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I
have spoken of a <span class='it'>very</span> unusual degree of activity as
requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult
a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the
thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but,
secondly and <span class='it'>chiefly</span>, I wish to impress upon your
understanding the <span class='it'>very extraordinary</span>—the almost
præternatural character of that agility which could
have accomplished it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will say, no doubt, using the language of
the law, that ‘to make out my case,’ I should
rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation
of the activity required in this matter. This may
be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of
reason. My ultimate object is only the truth. My
immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition,
that <span class='it'>very unusual</span> activity of which I have
just spoken, with that <span class='it'>very peculiar</span> shrill (or harsh)
and <span class='it'>unequal</span> voice, about whose nationality no two
persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance
no syllabification could be detected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words a vague and half-formed conception
of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind.
I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension,
without power to comprehend—as men, at times,
find themselves upon the brink of remembrance,
without being able, in the end, to remember. My
friend went on with his discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the
question from the mode of egress to that of ingress.
It was my design to convey the idea that both were
effected in the same manner, at the same point.
Let us now revert in fancy to the interior of the
room. Let us survey the appearances here. The
drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled,
although many articles of apparel still remained
within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It
is a mere guess—a very silly one—and no more.
How are we to know that the articles found in the
drawers were not all these drawers had originally
contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter
lived an exceedingly retired life—saw no company—seldom
went out—had little use for numerous
changes of habiliment. Those found were at least
of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by
these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he
not take the best—why did he not take all? In a
word why did he abandon four thousand francs in
gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen?
The gold <span class='it'>was</span> abandoned. Nearly the whole sum
mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was
discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you,
therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering
idea of <span class='it'>motive</span> engendered in the brains of the
police, by that portion of the evidence which speaks
of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences
ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery
of the money, and murder committed within
three days upon the party receiving it,) happen to
each and all of us every hour of our lives, without
attracting even a momentary notice. Coincidences
in general are great stumbling-blocks in the way of
that class of thinkers who have been educated to
know nothing, and care less, of the theory of probabilities—that
theory to which the most glorious
objects of human research are indebted for the most
glorious of illustration. In the present instance,
had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery
three days before would have formed something
more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative
of this idea of motive. But, under the
real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose
gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine
the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to
have abandoned his gold and his motive together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to
which I have drawn your attention—that peculiar
voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence
of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as
this—let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is
a woman strangled to death by manual strength,
and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary
assassins employ no such modes of murder as
this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered.
In the manner of thrusting the corpse up
the chimney, you will admit that there was something
<span class='it'>excessively outré</span>—something altogether irreconcilable
with our common notions of human
action, even when we suppose the actors the most
depraved of men. Think, too, what must have
been the degree of that strength which could have
thrust the body <span class='it'>up</span> such an aperture so forcibly that
the united vigor of several persons was found barely
sufficient to drag it <span class='it'>down</span>! Turn now to other
indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous.
On the hearth were thick tresses, very
thick tresses—of gray human hair. These had
been <span class='it'>torn out by the roots</span>. You are aware of the
great force necessary in tearing thus from the head
even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the
locks in question as well as myself. Their roots
(a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of
the flesh of the scalp—sure token of the prodigious
power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps
a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old
lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely
severed from the body. The instrument was a mere
razor. Here again we have evidence of that vastness
of strength upon which I would fix your attention.
I wish you also to look, and to look steadily,
at the <span class='it'>brutal</span> ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises
upon the body of Madame L’Espanaye I do not
speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor,
Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were
inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far
these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument
was clearly the stone pavement in the
yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the
window which looked in upon the bed. This idea,
however simple it may now seem, escaped the police
for the same reason that the breadth of the
shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of the
nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed
against the possibility of the windows having ever
been opened at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If now, in addition to all these things, you have
properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the
chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the
ideas of a strength superhuman, an agility astounding,
a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a
<span class='it'>grotesquerie</span> in horror absolutely alien from humanity,
and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men
of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible
syllabification. What result, then, has ensued?
What impression have I made upon your
fancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shuddered as Dupin asked me the question.
“A madman,” I said, “has done this deed—some
raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring <span class='it'>Maison
de Santé</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not
irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even in their
wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with
that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen
are of some nation, and their language, however
incoherent in its words, has always the coherence
of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman
is not such hair as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled
this little tuft from among the tresses remaining
upon the head of Madame L’Espanaye.
Tell me what you can make of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God,” I said, completely unnerved, “this
hair is most unusual—this is no <span class='it'>human</span> hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not asserted that it was,” said he, “but
before we decide upon this point, I wish you to
glance at the little sketch which I have here traced
upon this paper. It is a fac-simile drawing of what
has been described in one portion of the testimony
as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger
nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye,
and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,)
as ‘a series of livid spots, evidently the impression
of fingers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading
out the paper upon the table before us, “you
will perceive that this drawing gives the idea of a
firm and fixed hold. There is no <span class='it'>slipping</span> apparent.
Each finger has retained—possibly until the death
of the victim—the fearful grasp by which it originally
imbedded itself. Attempt now to place all
your fingers, at one and the same time, in the impressions
as you see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made the attempt in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair
trial,” he said. “The paper is spread out upon a
plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical.
Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which
is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing
around it, and try the experiment again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious
than before. “This,” I said, “is the mark of
no human hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly it is not,” replied Dupin; “read now
this passage from Cuvier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive
account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of
the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the
prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity,
and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are
sufficiently well known to all. I understood the
full horrors of the murder at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made
an end of reading, “is in exact accordance with this
drawing. I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang,
of the species here mentioned, could have
impressed the indentations as you have traced them.
This tuft of yellow hair is identical in character
with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly
comprehend the particulars of this frightful
mystery. Besides, there were two voices heard in
contention, and one of them was unquestionably the
voice of a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True; and you will remember an expression
attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to
this voice,—the expression, ‘<span class='it'>mon Dieu!</span>’ This,
under the circumstances, has been justly characterized
by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,)
as an expression of remonstrance or
expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I
have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the
riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder.
It is possible—indeed it is far more than probable—that
he was innocent of all participation in the
bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang
may have escaped from him. He may have
traced it to this chamber; but, under the agitating
circumstances which ensued, he could never have
re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue
these guesses—for I have no right to call them
more than guesses—since the shades of reflection
upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient
depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and
since I could not pretend to make them intelligible
to the understanding of another than myself. We
will call them guesses then, and speak of them as
such. If the Frenchman in question be indeed, as
I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement,
which I left last night, upon our return home,
at the office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to
the shipping interest, and much sought for by sailors,)
will bring him to our residence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed me a paper, and I read thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Caught</span>—<span class='it'>In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the
morning of the — inst.</span>, (the morning of the murder,)
<span class='it'>a very large, tawny-colored Ourang-Outang
of the Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained
to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,)
may have the animal again, upon identifying it
satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising
from its capture and keeping. Call at No. —,
Rue ——, Faubourg St. Germain—au troisième.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you
should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging
to a Maltese vessel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do <span class='it'>not</span> know it,” said Dupin. “I am not
<span class='it'>sure</span> of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon,
which has evidently, from its form, and from
its greasy appearance, been used in tying the hair in
one of those long <span class='it'>queues</span> of which sailors are so
fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides
sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I
picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod.
It could not have belonged to either of the deceased.
Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from
this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging
to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done
no harm in stating what I did in the advertisement.
If I am in error he will merely suppose that I have
been misled by some circumstance into which he
will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am
right—a great point is gained. Cognizant of the
murder, although not guilty, the Frenchman will
naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about
demanding the Ourang-Outang. He
will reason thus:—‘I am innocent; I am poor;
my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my
circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose
it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it
is within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de
Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene of that
butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a
brute beast should have done the deed? The police
are at fault—they have failed to procure the slightest
clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would
be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder,
or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance.
Above all, <span class='it'>I am known</span>. The advertiser
designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am
not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend.
Should I avoid claiming a property of so great a
value, which it is known that I possess, I will render
the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is
not my policy to attract attention either to myself
or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement—get
the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this
matter has blown over.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but
neither show them nor use them until at a signal
from myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The front door of the house had been left open,
and the visiter had entered without ringing or rapping,
and advanced several steps upon the staircase.
Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently
we heard him descending. Dupin was moving
quickly to the door, when we again heard him
coming up. He did not turn back a second time,
but stepped up quickly, and rapped at the door of
our chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visiter entered. He was a sailor, evidently—a
tall, stout, and muscular-looking man, with a certain
dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether
unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,
was more than half hidden by a world of whisker
and <span class='it'>mustachio</span>. He had with him a huge oaken
cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He
bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in
French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatel-ish,
were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian
origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin, “I suppose
you have called about the Ourang-Outang. Upon
my word, I almost envy you the possession of him;
a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable
animal. How old do you suppose him to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a
man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then
replied, in an assured tone,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no way of telling—but he can’t be more
than four or five years old. Have you got him
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no—we had no conveniences for keeping
him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg,
just by. You can get him in the morning.
Of course you are prepared to identify the property?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I am, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean that you should be at all this
trouble for nothing, sir,” said the man. “Couldn’t
expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for
the finding of the animal—that is to say, any reward
in reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair,
to be sure. Let me think!—what reward ought I
to have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall
be this. You shall give me all the information in
your power about that affair of the murder in the
Rue Morgue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dupin said these last words in a very low tone,
and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, he walked
towards the door, locked it, and put the key in his
pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and
placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor’s face flushed up with an ungovernable
tide of crimson. He started to his feet and grasped
his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into
his seat trembling convulsively, and with the countenance
of death itself. He spoke not a single word.
I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you
are alarming yourself unnecessarily—you are indeed.
We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you
the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that
we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know
that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue
Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you
are in some measure implicated in them. From
what I have already said, you must know that I
have had means of information about this matter—means
of which you could never have dreamed.
Now the thing stands thus. You have done nothing
which you could have avoided—nothing certainly
which renders you culpable. You were not even
guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with
impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have
no reason for concealment. On the other hand,
you are bound by every principle of honor to confess
all that you know. An innocent man is now
imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you
can point out the perpetrator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor had recovered his presence of mind in
a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words;
but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause,
“I <span class='it'>will</span> tell you all that I know about this affair;—but
I do not expect you to believe one half that I
say—I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I <span class='it'>am</span>
innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die
for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not propose to follow the man in the circumstantial
narrative which he now detailed. What
he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately
made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago. A party,
of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and
passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure.
Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang.
This companion dying, the animal fell
into his own exclusive possession. After great
trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his
captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded
in lodging it safely at his own residence in
Paris, where, not to attract towards himself the unpleasant
curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully
secluded, until such time as it should recover
from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter
on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning home from some sailors’ frolic on the
night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he
found his prisoner occupying his own bed-room,
into which he had broken from a closet adjoining,
where he had been, as it was thought, securely confined.
The beast, razor in hand, and fully lathered,
was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the
operation of shaving, in which he had no doubt
previously watched his master through the key-hole
of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous
a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious,
and so well able to use it, the man, for some
moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been
accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in
its fiercest moods, by the use of a strong wagoner’s
whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of
it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the
door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence,
through a window, unfortunately open, into the
street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman followed in despair—the ape,
razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look
back and gesticulate at his pursuer, until the latter
had nearly come up with him. He then again made
off. In this manner the chase continued for a long
time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was
nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing
down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the
fugitive’s attention was arrested by a light (the only
one apparent except those of the town-lamps) gleaming
from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s
chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing
to the building, he perceived the lightning-rod,
clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the
shutter, which was thrown fully back against the
wall, and, by its means swung himself directly upon
the head-board of the bed. The whole feat did not
occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open
again by the Ourang-Outang as he entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced
and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing
the ape, as it could scarcely escape from
the trap into which it had ventured, except by the
rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down.
On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety
as to what the brute might do in the house.
This latter reflection urged the man still to follow
the fugitive. A lightning rod is ascended without
difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had
arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his
left, his career was stopped; the most that he
could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain
a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this
glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess
of horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks
arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber
the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame
L’Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night
clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging
some papers in the iron chest already mentioned,
which had been wheeled into the middle of the room.
It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the
floor. Their backs must have been towards the
window; and, by the time elapsing between the
screams and the ingress of the ape, it seems probable
that he was not immediately perceived. The
flapping-to of the shutter they would naturally have
attributed to the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sailor looked in, the gigantic beast had
seized Madame L’Espanaye by the hair, (which was
loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing
the razor about her face, in imitation of the
motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate
and motionless; she had swooned. The screams
and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair
was torn from her head) had the effect of changing
the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang
into those of ungovernable wrath. With one determined
sweep of his muscular arm he nearly severed
her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed
his anger into phrenzy. Gnashing his teeth,
and flashing fire from his eyes, he flew upon the
body of the girl, and imbedded his fearful talons in
her throat, retaining his grasp until she expired.
His wandering and wild glances fell at this moment
upon the head of the bed, over which those of his
master, glazed in horror, were just discernible. The
fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind
the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into
dread. Conscious of having deserved punishment,
he seemed desirous to conceal his bloody deeds, and
skipped about the chamber in an apparent agony of
nervous agitation, throwing down and breaking the
furniture as he moved, and dragging the bed from
the bedstead. In conclusion, he seized first the
corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney,
as it was found; then that of the old lady, with
which he rushed to the window, precipitating it immediately
therefrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the ape approached him with his mutilated
burden, the sailor shrunk aghast to the rod, and
rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at
once home—dreading the consequences of the butchery,
and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude
about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The
words heard by the party upon the staircase were
the Frenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright,
commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the
brute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang
must have escaped from the chamber, by the
rod, just before the breaking of the door. He must
have closed the window as he passed through it.
He was subsequently caught by the owner himself,
who obtained for him a very large sum at the <span class='it'>Jardin
des Plantes</span>. Le Bon was instantly released
upon our narration of the circumstances (with some
comments from Dupin) at the <span class='it'>bureau</span> of the <span class='it'>Préfet de
police</span>. This functionary, however well disposed
to my friend, could not altogether conceal his
chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and
was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, in regard
to the propriety of every person minding his own
business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought
it necessary to reply. “Let him discourse; it will
ease his conscience. I am satisfied with having
defeated him in his own castle. In truth, he is too
cunning to be acute. There is no <span class='it'>stamen</span> in his
wisdom. It is all head and no body—like the pictures
of the goddess Laverna—or at least all head
and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good
fellow, after all. I like him especially for one master
stroke of cant, by which he has attained that
reputation for ingenuity which he possesses. I mean
the way he has ‘<span class='it'>de nier ce qui est, et d’expliquer
ce qui n’est pas</span>.’ ”</p>

<div><h1><a id='reef'></a>THE REEFER OF ’76.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “CRUISING IN THE LAST WAR.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE MESS-ROOM.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is scarcely necessary to detail the occurrences
of that celebrated cruize. Success appeared to follow
us wherever we went. After our escape from
the man-of-war,—which we subsequently learned to
be the Solebay, mounting twenty-eight guns—we
ran farther eastward, and soon fell in with several
prizes. One morning, however, our look-out detected
a strange frigate hovering upon the sea-board,
nor was it long before we discovered her to
be an enemy. We made her out, by the aid of
our glasses, to be a light frigate, pierced for sixteen
guns on a side. Every rag that would draw was
instantly set. With equal alacrity the stranger followed
our example, and a running fight was commenced,
which lasted nearly the whole day; for
our daring leader, finding that we could easily
outsail the enemy, kept just out of range of her
guns, so that, although she maintained a constant
fire, every shot fell short. Toward night-fall, however,
we gave full rein to our gallant craft, and, to
the astonishment and chagrin of the Englishman,
left him hull down in a few hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After hauling aboard our tacks, we ran up toward
Canseau, and for some time inflicted serious damage
upon the enemy’s fishermen, around the coast of
Nova Scotia. Having finally captured no less than
sixteen sail, some of them very valuable, we left the
scene of our late exploits, and swept down the coast
toward Montauk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cloudless afternoon when we made
Block Island, and, as the sun set behind its solitary
outline, tinting the sky with a thousand varied dyes,
and prolonging the shadow of the coast along the
deep, we beheld a small schooner, close-hauled,
opening around the northern extremity of the island.
In less than a half hour she was close to windward
of us. As it was the first friendly craft we had seen
for weeks, we were all naturally anxious to learn
the state of affairs on land. Paul Jones himself
leaped into the rigging and hailed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahoy! what craft is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Mary Ann of Newport,” answered a nasal
voice from the low deck of the stranger, “what
vessel air you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Providence continental sloop—come to
under our lee and send a boat aboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir!” answered the same voice, but in
an altered tone, and with the ready alacrity of a
true seaman, “round her to, boys; but may be,”
continued he, again addressing us, “you hain’t
heerd the news yet. I calculate it’ll make the
British think we Yankees ain’t to be made slaves
of arter all—<span class='it'>independence is declared</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!—the Congress declared itself independent
of Great Britain?” asked Paul Jones, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! by —,” but the half muttered oath of the
seaman died away in a prolonged whistle, as he remembered
how unbecoming an oath would be from
a deacon of the church. For an instant there was
a profound silence, while we gazed into each other’s
faces, with mingled wonder, delight, and pride. The
news was not wholly unhoped for, though we had
scarcely ventured to expect it. A topman was the
first to speak. Forgetting every thing in his enthusiasm,
he shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three cheers, my boys, for freedom,—huzza!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, suiting the action to the word, he broke
into a thundering shout, which, taken up by our
own crew, was answered back by that of the
schooner, until the very heavens seemed to echo
the sound. It was a stirring moment. A universal
transport appeared to have seized upon our
gallant fellows; they threw up their hats, they
shook each other’s hands, they laughed, they swore,
and the more volatile even danced; while Paul
Jones himself, with a flushed cheek and kindling
eye, timed the huzzas of his patriotic crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before twenty-four hours we were at anchor in
Newport, and almost the first craft that I beheld in
the harbor, was the saucy little <span class='sc'>Fire-Fly</span>. The
welcome I received from my shipmates I will not
attempt to describe. Over our cold junk and
Jamaica, I listened to the narrative of their adventures
since our parting, and rehearsed in return my
own. My arrival was opportune, for the schooner
expected to sail in less than a week, and had I been
delayed many days longer, I might have found it
impossible to have rejoined her during the war.
The little time that we remained in port after my
arrival, was spent in a constant round of amusements,
such only as a set of gay reckless reefers
know how to indulge in. Many a gay song was
trolled, and many a mirthful tale related by lips
that have long since been stilled in death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what of Beatrice? Had she forgotten me?
No—the dear creature had availed herself of one
of the rare opportunities which then presented
themselves occasionally of communicating with the
north, to answer a long epistle I had transmitted to
her, by a chance vessel, we met a few days after
leaving Charleston. Oh! with what simple, yet
nervous eloquence did she assure me of her unabated
love, and how sweetly did she chide me for
the doubts I had—sinner that I was—whispered
respecting it. I kissed the dear missive again and
again; I read it over and over a thousand times; I
treasured it the more because I knew not when the
chances of war would suffer me to hear from her
again. I feared not now the influence of her uncle:
I felt in my inmost soul that Beatrice was too pure,
too self-devoted in her love ever to sacrifice it for
lucre. And as I felt this it flashed across me that
perhaps she might have heard of my being lost
overboard from the merchantman; and who knew
but that even now she might be mourning me as
dead? Happily a brig was now in port about to
sail for Charleston. I seized the opportunity, and
wrote to inform Beatrice of my safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few days our outfit was completed, and
bidding adieu to my friends on board the Providence,
we set sail from Newport. The day was
bright and glorious, and the sunbeams danced merrily
upon the waves. A light breeze murmured
through the rigging; the gay song of the sailors
from the merchantmen in port floated softly past;
and the scream of the sea-birds broke shrilly over
us, high in the clear blue sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the day advanced, however, a thin, gauze-like
vapor gradually spread over the horizon, deepening
before four bells in the afternoon watch to an impervious
canopy of black, which stretching from pole
to pole, obscured the whole firmament, and threw
a premature and sickly gloom over the deep beneath.
The wind, too, began to rise, blowing in
irregular puffs, and whitening the surface of the sea
in patches over the whole of its wide extent; while
occasionally a low, half-smothered murmur, as if
arising out of the very heart of the ocean, betokened
that the elements of the storm were at work far
down in their wild recesses. As the day advanced
the sky became even more ominous, until long
before night-fall its weird-like grandeur excelled any
thing I had ever beheld. By this time, too, the
wind had increased almost into a hurricane, and
with every thing trimmed down, we were cleaving
through the fast whitening billows with an exhilarating
velocity that only a sailor can appreciate.
The rain meanwhile was falling fast. As night
came on the watch was set, and most of us went
below, so that all off duty were soon congregated
in our mess-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wild night,” said the last comer, as he shook
the wet from his shaggy jacket, “and I see you’re
determined to make the most of it, my boys—push
us the Jamaica, Parker, and don’t forget the junk
in passing. Here’s to the thirteen united colonies,
hurrah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah! hurrah! hip—hip—hurrah!” rung
around the crowded room, as we drank off our
bumpers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you give us a toast, O’Shaughnessy?”
sung out Westbrook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shure and what shall it be?” said he, with
humorous simplicity. A general roar of laughter
followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any thing, my hearty,” said Westbrook,
cramming a piece of junk into his mouth as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrah thin, and ye’ll not refuse to dhrink the
memory of our gallant comrade,” said he, looking
hard at me, “present this blessed minit, who fought,
bled, and died at Fort Moultrie—Misther Parker, I
mane, boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The explosions of laughter which followed this
speech, like successive peals of thunder, were
enough to lift the deck of the schooner off bodily
from overhead. But the most laughable part of all
was the amazement of poor O’Shaughnessy, who,
unable to understand this new burst of merriment,
looked from one to another, in humorous perplexity.
As soon, however, as the company could compose
itself, the toast was drunk amid a whirlwind of
huzzas. I rose to return thanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear him—hear him,” roared a dozen voices.
I began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honored as I am, gentlemen, by this token
of—of,” but here I was interrupted by the entrance
of the purser, who, poking his head through the
narrow doorway, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, the captain must be informed of
this riot if it continues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purser was a stiff, starch, precise old scoundrel,
with a squint in his eye, a nasal twang, and
an itching after money beyond even that of Shylock.
To make a dollar he would descend to the meanest
shifts. But this would not have irritated the mess
so much, even though he had at one time or another
fleeced every member of it, had it not been
his constant practice to inform on such of the tricks
inseparable to a set of youngsters as came under
his notice. He was, in short, a skulking spy.
Added to this he was continually affecting a strictness
of morals which was more than suspected to
be hypocritical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who made you keeper of the skipper’s
conscience?—eh! old plunderer,” said Westbrook,
as he shied a biscuit at the purser’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, gentlemen, really—I—I must—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, or you’ll catch cold in the draught,”
sung out our reckless comrade, “your teeth chatter
so now you can’t talk. Haul him in there,
O’Shaughnessy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick as the word the unlucky interloper was
dragged in, the door shut, and he stood turning
from one to another of our group in speechless
amazement. We were all ready for any mischief.
The rattling of the cordage overhead, the thunder
of the surge, and the deafening whistle of the hurricane
we knew would drown all the uproar we
might occasion, and afford us impunity for any
offence. Besides it was no part of his duty to be
intruding on our mess, and threatening us with
punishment. We had a long account to settle
with our extortioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope you find yourself at home—take a sociable
glass, that’s a good fellow—glad to see you
amongst us,” sung out as many voices as biscuit
after biscuit was sent at the purser’s head, while
Westbrook mixing a stiff tumbler of salt and water
proffered it to our victim to drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spu—spu—gentlemen, spu, I promise you—the
utmost penalty of—of the regulations—you
shall be mast-headed—disrated—you shall, so help
me God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A penalty! a penalty! the worthy man is profane:
how shall we punish such immorality?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cob him,” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keel-haul him,” said another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make him receipt for his bill,” roared a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give him the salt and water,” chimed in Westbrook,
and the salt and water it was agreed should
be the penalty. Three stout reefers held the loathing
victim fast, while Westbrook proceeded to administer
the draught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen—I—I—protest—a—gainst—you
shall suffer for this—you shall—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aisy, you spalpeen you, aisy,” said O’Shaughnessy,
giving the purser a shake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Westbrook, I warn you—I warn you,”
said the purser raising his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But our comrade was not to be intimidated.
Taking the glass in one hand, he placed himself at
a proper distance in front of the struggling man,
and gravely commenced haranguing him on the
enormity of his offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pains me, indeed, Mr. Sower,” and here
Westbrook laid his hand upon his heart, “to hear
a man of your character use such language as you
have been convicted of, especially in the presence
of these misguided young reprobates,” here there
was a general laugh, “example, example, my dear
sir, is every thing. But the deed is done: the
penalty alone remains to be paid. With a heart
torn with the most poignant anguish I proceed to
execute your sentence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Westbrook, again I warn you—spe—e—u—uh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in vain the purser kicked, and struggled, and
spluttered. The mess was too much for him. One
seized him by the nose, a second forced open his
mouth, and Westbrook, with inimitable gravity,
apologising for, and bemoaning his melancholy duty,—as
he called it—in the same breath, poured the
nauseating draught down the victim’s throat, amid
roars of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D——n, I’ll make you pay for this—I will—I
will,” roared the purser, almost choked with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the door and let him run,” laughed Westbrook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mandate was obeyed, and with one bound the
purser sprang out of the mess-room, while his merry
persecutors, holding their sides, laughed until the
tears ran out of their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A song—give us a song, Westbrook!” shouted
the one at the foot of the table, as soon as the merriment,
ceasing for a while, but renewed again and
again, had finally died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall it be?” said our jovial messmate,
“ah! our own mess-room song, Parker hasn’t
heard it yet—shove us the jug, for I’m confoundedly
dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having taken a long draught, Westbrook hemmed
twice, and sang in a fine manly tenor, the
following stanzas:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He seeks but the foe to defy him;</p>
<p class='line0'>He fights for his honor and country’s laws,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He fights for the mother that bore him,—</p>
<p class='line0'>And the hireling slave of a tyrant’s cause</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Will quail, like a coward, before him.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The deep may unfetter its surges dread,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo! three times three!” and the triple sound
rolled stunningly from our throats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark! wasn’t that the boatswain’s whistle?”
said I, and for a moment we paused in our applause
to listen. But the tumult of the storm drowned
everything in its fierce uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again, boys—hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” and
the cheers were renewed with redoubled vigor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, all hands on deck,” said the quarter-master,
opening the door at this moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! ay! sir,” was the simultaneous response
of every member of the mess, and in less than a
minute our late noisy apartment was as quiet as
the tomb, and we had each taken his post on deck.
Such is discipline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectacle that met our vision as we reached
the deck, drove at once, all the excitement of our potations
off; and we were as calm and collected in a
second after leaving the gang-way, as if we had
kept above during the whole evening. Never can
I forget that moment. The rain was pouring down
in torrents, not perpendicularly, however, but slant-wise,
as it was driven before the hurricane. Now
it beat fiercely into our faces, and now was whirled
hither and thither in wild commotion. Around, all
was dark as pitch. We could not see a dozen
fathoms in any direction, except where the white
crests of the surges flashed through the gloom.
These could, however, be detected close under our
lee glancing through the darkness, while the dull
continued roar in that quarter, betokened our immediate
vicinity to breakers. They were in fact,
close aboard. Had they not been detected the
instant they were, we should have run on to them
the next minute, and perished to a soul. Happily
we had just room to wear. This had been done
before we were summoned on deck. We had now
close-hauled every thing, and were endeavoring, as
our only hope, to claw off the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next fifteen minutes were spent in that
agonising suspense, for more terrible than death
itself, which men experience when the king of terror
smiles grimly in their faces, and yet witholds
the blow. As we gazed out, through the driving
rain, upon the dimly seen breakers on our starboard
beam, and heard their wild monotonous roar as of
hounds yelling for their prey, a sense of inexpressible
awe stole upon our minds, which, though totally
devoid of fear, was yet appalling. Who knew but
that, before another hour, aye! before a quarter of
that time, our mangled bodies might be floating at
the mercy of the surge? Every moment deepened
our anxiety, for though our little craft breasted the
waves with gallant determination, sending the spray
as high as her mast head at every plunge, yet there
was no perceptible increase in our distance from the
shore. Fierce, and fiercer, meanwhile, grew the
tempest. The surge roared under our lee; the
wind howled by like the wailings of the damned;
and the occasional lightnings, which now began to
illuminate the scene, lit up the whole firmament a
moment with their ghastly glare, and then left it
shrouded in darkness deeper than that of the day of
doom. At intervals the thunder bellowed overhead
or went crackling in prolonged echoes down the
sky. The schooner groaned and quivered in every
timber. Now we rose to the heavens; now wallowed
in the abyss. The men, grasping each a
rope, looked ominously at the scene around, or cast
hurried glances aloft as if fearful that our masts
would not stand the strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” said Westbrook, who stood beside me,
“was not that a gun?—there again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke the sullen roar of a cannon boomed
across the deep, and for several successive minutes,
in the intervals of the thunder, followed the same
awful sound. We looked at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are signals of distress,” I ejaculated,
“God have mercy on the sufferers! for man can
afford them no help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had scarcely ceased speaking when a succession
of rapid, vivid flashes of lightning, illumined the
stormy prospect for several minutes, as with the
light of day; and for the first time we caught a glimpse
of the rocky coast, on our lee, against which the
surge was breaking in a hurricane of foam. But
fearful as was the spectacle of our own danger, it
was surpassed by the sight which met our eager
gaze. About a cable’s length ahead, and a few
points on our lee bow, was a tall and gallant bark,
dismantled and broached to, upon a reef of jagged
rocks, now buried in foam. Her weather quarter
lay high upon the ledge, and was crowded with
unfortunate human beings, men, women and children,
over whom the surges broke momentarily in cataracts.
I hear now their wild despairing cries,
although years have passed since then. I see their
outstretched hands as they call on heaven for mercy.
I feel again the cold chill, freezing up my very
blood, which then rushed across my heart, as I
thought of their inevitable doom, and knew not but
that in a few moments I should share its bitterness
with them. I was startled by a deep voice at my
side. It was that of an old warrant officer. The
tears were streaming down his weather-beaten cheeks,
and his tones were husky and full of emotion as he
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a sad spectacle that for a father, Mr.
Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, Hawser—but why do you shed tears?—cheer
up, man—it’s not all over with us yet,” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! sir, it’s not fear that makes me so, but I
was thinking what my little ones, and their poor
mother would do for bread to eat, should I be
taken away from them. You are not a father, Mr.
Parker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive me, Hawser, for my suspicion. I
honor your emotions,” said I, pressing his horny
hand, and turning away to conceal my own feelings.
But as I did so, I felt something hot fall
upon my finger. It was the old man’s tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must give her another reef, I fear,” said
the captain, as he saw how fearfully the vessel
strained, “no, no,” he added, as he glanced again
at the rocky coast, “it will never do. Keep her to
it,” he thundered, raising his voice, “keep her to it,
quarter-master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were now almost abreast of the ill-fated
wreck. Driving rapidly along, the dark waters sinking
in foam beneath our lee as we breasted the
opposing surge, our fate promised soon to be the
same with that of the wretches on the reef. The
crisis was at hand. We were in dangerous proximity
to the dismantled ship; and the least falling off
would roll us in upon her. It was even doubtful
whether we could weather the reef, should we still
hold our own. At this moment a ray of hope appeared.
We perceived that the shore shelved in
just beyond the wreck, and that, if we could escape
the ledge, our safety would be ensured. The captain
took in at a glance this new situation of affairs,
which, by holding out hope, redoubled every motive
to action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How bears she?” he anxiously inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man answered promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard up—press her down more,” he shouted,
and then muttered, between his teeth “or we are
lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is almost shaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does she bear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A point more in the wind’s eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harder yet, harder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another point, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crisis had now come. Bending almost to
the horizon, under the enormous press of her canvass,
the schooner groaned and struggled against
the seas, and for one moment of intense agony,
during which we held our breaths painfully, and
even forgot the cries of the sufferers upon our lee,
we thought that all was over; but, although the
schooner staggered under the successive shocks,
she did not yield, and as the last billow sank away,
whitening beneath her lee, and we rose gallantly
upon its crest, the rocky reef shot away astern,
and we were safe. As the wreck vanished in the
gloom behind, the cries of her despairing passengers
came mingled with the roar of the tempest, in
awful distinctness, to our ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a summer afternoon, and the sunlight,
glimmering through the branches of the old oak
trees, fell with a rich glow upon the green sward
beneath, lighting up the dark vistas of the forest,
and disclosing long avenues of stately trees, through
which the deer trotted in the distance, presenting
altogether a picture of woodland scenery such as
the eye rarely beholds, when two females might
have been seen sauntering idly along, listening to
the gay echoes of their own voices as they conversed
in those light-hearted tones, which only youth
and innocence employ. The foremost of the two,
by the stateliness of her mien, and the richness of
her dress, appeared to be of higher rank than her
companion; and as she turned occasionally to converse
with her attendant, she disclosed one of the
most beautiful countenances that poet ever dreamed
of, or painter pictured. A noble contour; a snowy
forehead; a finely chiselled mouth; and a pair of
dark lustrous eyes that shone like a cloudless night
into the gazer’s soul, made up a face of surpassing
loveliness. And as she conversed, each successive
thought would flash up into her countenance, making
it, as it were, the mirror of the pure soul beneath,
and giving it an expression, such as the pen
would find it impossible to describe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth! Ruth!” said this fair vision, suddenly
pausing, “hear you nothing—surely that was the
cry of dogs—can we have wandered so far from
the lodge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The color faded from the attendant’s cheek as
her mistress ceased speaking, and the deep bay of
approaching hounds floated down the avenues of
the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us fly—fly, dear lady,” said the terrified
girl, “or the stag will be upon us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words had scarcely left her mouth before a
crashing was heard in a neighboring thicket, and
before the females could move more than a few
steps from their position, a huge antlered stag,
dripping with blood and foam, burst out of the
copse, and made toward them. The attendant
shrieked, and clasping her mistress’ robe, stood
unable to move. Had the maiden been equally
paralysed, their destruction would have been unavoidable.
But in that moment of peril, though
the cheek of the lady Margaret became a trifle
paler than usual, her presence of mind did not
desert her. Seizing her attendant’s arm energetically,
she dragged her toward a huge oak behind
them, whose giant trunk would afford a momentary
barrier against the infuriated animal. Had the lady
Margaret been alone and unencumbered, she would
have succeeded in her endeavor, but her nearly
senseless companion so retarded her progress that
the stag had almost overtaken them while yet
several paces from the tree. Another instant and
their fate would be sealed. But at that crisis she
heard a whizzing by her ear, and an arrow, sped
by an unseen hand, pierced the heart of the stag,
who leaping madly forward with a last effort, fell
dead at her feet. At the same moment a light and
active form, arrayed in a dress of Lincoln green,
sprang out from a neighboring copse, and lifting
his cap to the ladies, begged to enquire after their
affright, in a tone so courtly for one of his apparent
station, that Margaret involuntarily looked closer
at the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was apparently about twenty-five years of
age, with an open and generous countenance, enlivened
by one of those merry blue eyes which
were characteristic in those days, of the pure
Saxon blood of their possessor. A jaunty cap,
with a long white feather drooping over it, was set
upon the stranger’s head; while a green coat, made
somewhat after the fashion of a hunting frock of
the present day, and crossed by a wide belt from
which depended a bugle, set off his graceful form.
Altogether the intruder was as gallant a looking
forester as ever trod the greensward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hounds are in full cry,” continued the
stranger, without shrinking at the scrutiny of the
lady, “and will soon be upon us. Will you suffer
me to be your protector from this scene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady Margaret bowed, and pointing to her
attendant, who had now fainted, thanked their preserver
for his offer, and signified her willingness to
accept it. The youth made no answer, but seizing
the prostrate maiden in his arms, he pointed to the
copse from which he had emerged, and hastily followed
Margaret into it. The branches, where they
passed in their retreat, had scarcely ceased vibrating,
when the hounds dashed into the space they
had left, and in a moment after a gay train of
hunters followed with horn and halloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the young stranger, bearing the form
of Ruth in his arms, hastily traversed the forest, by
paths that others could scarcely have detected, until
he reached the margin of an open glade, at whose
extremity stood a low-roofed lodge, such as was
then used for the residence of a keeper of the
forest. Here the stranger hesitated a moment, but
finally perceiving that no one was in sight, he pressed
across the glade, and only paused when he had
deposited his now reviving burden on a cot in the
lodge. The next moment he turned to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May—may we know to whom we are indebted
for this timely aid?” faltered the lady Margaret,
crimsoning as she spoke, with an agitation of manner
unusual to the high-bred heiress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youth hesitated a moment, looked wistfully
at the maiden, and seemed on the point of answering,
when footsteps were heard approaching. Hastily
bowing to Margaret, he ejaculated,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may meet again, farewell!” and vanished
from the portal. His form disappeared in the forest
as the keeper entered and saluted the lady Margaret
and his daughter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Chapter II.</span></h2>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The Earl of Mountfort’s only daughter, the lady
Margaret, was at once an heiress and a beauty.
Early deprived of a mother’s care; buried in the
seclusion of her father’s various castles; and knowing
nothing of the great world without, she had
attained the age of eighteen, without suffering any
diminution of that enthusiasm which is so beautiful
in early youth, but which a few year’s collision with
mankind wears off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her earliest childhood Ruth Herewood, the
forester’s daughter, had been her bosom companion;
for in that day, when young females of noble rank
could rarely associate together, their handmaidens
were often their sole confidants. Ruth, moreover,
was a foster sister to the lady Margaret, and the
tie, therefore, which bound them together was one
not lightly thought of, nor easily severed. It was
no unusual thing for the young heiress, at least
once a year, to spend a fortnight or even more at
the lodge of Mr. Herewood, who held the office of
a keeper in one of the king’s forests. At such
times she was unattended, except by a few faithful
servants. It was during one of these visits that
her life had been preserved in the manner we have
related. With these explanations let us return to
our story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A significant sign from her mistress put Ruth
upon her guard, and as the stranger had disappeared
before her father’s entrance, Mr. Herewood
remained in ignorance of the danger from
which the females had escaped. The motives
which prompted Margaret to this concealment we
shall not attempt to divine. Perhaps it was only
a passing whim; but if so it was changed into a
settled resolution, when, on the following morning
Ruth’s father acquainted them with the fact that a
stag had been found shot in the forest by the royal
hunting party, and that so daring a breach of the
forest laws would assuredly be punished with the utmost
penalty that rigorous code afforded. Alarmed
and perplexed, Margaret determined to conceal all
knowledge of the stranger, lest, by her means, he
might be detected; for she feared that her rescuer
was one of those outlaws who were known to infest
the forest, and that though he might find immunity
for that particular offence, he could not
escape being convicted of others as heinous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Margaret could not forget her preserver. In
her waking or sleeping dreams his manly form was
ever before her, looking as it did when he sprang
from the copse to her rescue; and as often as the
vision recurred to her memory she owned to herself
that she had never seen anyone of such rare manly
beauty. She strolled oftener than ever into the
forest, and Ruth noticed—for are not all women
quick to notice such things?—that whenever her
theme of conversation was their unknown preserver,
her mistress listened to her with more than common
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several days had now elapsed since their escape
from the stag, when, one afternoon, Margaret and
Ruth, found themselves in that portion of the forest
where their fright had occurred. As it was some
distance from the lodge, they felt fatigued by their
walk, and sitting down on a shady knoll, naturally
fell into a conversation on the stranger who had so
opportunely come to their aid. But a few minutes
had thus passed when a light step was heard approaching,
and as the females hastily arose, the
stranger stood before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be not alarmed, fair lady,” said he, lifting his
cap, and addressing Margaret, “I said when we
parted the other day that we might meet again. I
redeem my word. But if my presence affrights you
I retire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden blushed deeply at this address, so
unlike that of one in the speaker’s sphere of life.
Her bosom was agitated, meanwhile, with contending
emotions, which produced a momentary embarrassment
and confusion in her countenance, only
serving to heighten her beauty in the stranger’s
eyes. At length she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir stranger, do you not run a risk by
this? Believe me I would not have you come to
ill, but I know that danger besets your footsteps.
Then,” she added, more earnestly than the next
moment she thought maidenly, “fly from the
forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger smiled as he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think that the outlaw’s life is hazardous;
but I have only to sound this,” and he lightly
touched his bugle, “and a score of stout arms are
around me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something so fascinating in the stranger’s
manner that, despite her better judgment, Margaret
felt chained to the spot. Nor did Ruth show
any greater disposition to depart. Before five minutes
had elapsed, Margaret found herself conversing
with the gallant outlaw as freely as if she had
known him for months. If, for a moment, she
would think such conduct improper, the next
reflection would be had he not saved her life?
Besides was not Ruth at hand? Is it a wonder,
therefore, that the grateful girl suffered the stranger
to linger by her side for nearly an hour, or that
after they had parted, she thought of him oftener
than she would have been willing a week before to
admit she could ever think of any one except her
father? Is it a wonder that she often strolled into
the forest with Ruth, and that she never returned
without having seen the outlaw? In a word is it
any wonder that she loved?</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing in this care-worn world so
sweet and innocent as a young girl’s first love.
Then—when the heart is fresh, when every thought
is pure, when the poetry of life has not yet been
crushed out of the soul, when as we are nearer to
our childhood we are nearer to heaven—then it is
that we love with an intensity such as we never
love with again. And thus Margaret loved. She
knew it not until it was impossible for her to drive
away her passion. It had crept on her, slowly but
surely, and oh! how sweetly, until it became a part
of her being, and the day in which she did not see
her lover, passed tediously and mournfully to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though loving as few love, even in the fervor
of a first passion, Margaret was still ignorant
of her lover’s name. Often would she be tortured
by fears lest he might have already forfeited his life
in the career of an outlaw, but as often would she
quiet her alarm by reflecting how impossible that a
mere freebooter should be so courteous and even
refined. In all this there was a mystery which did
but feed the love of her highly imaginative mind,
and though, day after day, would she resolve to
question her lover so closely respecting himself that
he could not evade her inquiries, yet, day after day,
would she be diverted from, and forget it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly three weeks had now elapsed, and the
period limited for her stay at the lodge had passed,
when a messenger arrived from her father, to conduct
her to one of his castles in the vicinity of
London. Who can tell her feelings at receiving this
summons?—a summons which would tear her from
her lover, perhaps forever. But it opened to her
more fully than ever the state of her heart, convinced
her of her imprudence in suffering herself
to love an unknown stranger, and determined her
to learn that very day from her lover’s lips his
name and station in life. Ah! pitiable indeed were
her feelings as she reflected on her folly. But a
flood of tears afforded her partial relief, and calling
for Ruth to accompany her she set forth into the
forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a glorious old place was that royal hunting
ground. For miles before you stretched a succession
of hills and dales, covered with venerable and
gigantic trees, or spreading out into rich meadows;
while herds of deer might be seen trotting far off
through the vistas of the forest, and here and there
a cottage peeping out from beneath the verdant foliage.
In some places the dark overshadowing
trees completely obscured the light of day, and in
others, the sunbeams struggling between the leaves
gilded the greensward beneath. Such was the
scene through which Margaret took her way, until
she reached the open glade, where, of late, she had
met her lover. Scarcely had she emerged from the
surrounding woods before he sprang to her side, and
in a moment she was in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We meet again, dearest,” said he, kissing the
fair cheek that blushed crimson at his caress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I fear, for the last time,” said Margaret,
“my father has sent for me, and to-morrow I leave
this place. Oh! when,” and she looked into his
eyes with all a woman’s tenderness, “shall we meet
again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going!—and so soon!” muttered her lover,
abstractedly, “why dearest, why did you not tell
me of this before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was but this morning that I heard of it.
Alas! that we should part so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how know you, sweet one, that we must
part?” said her lover half smilingly. It recalled to
Margaret’s mind her determination to learn her
lover’s history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said she, “are you not a mere,” and
her voice faltered, “a mere soldier of fortune, perhaps—,”
and again she faltered and looked down,
“an outlaw? Can you follow me? Oh! would you
could,” and the unhappy maiden burst into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, dear Margaret? Have not good
men and true, at times, been driven to the greenwood
for a temporary livelihood. Know you not how
the good Earl of Huntingdon long kept wassail
under the trees of old Sherwood with his ‘merrie
men?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! then say you are like him—say you are
not an outlaw! Did you but know how my heart
reproves me for all this—how I weep to think that
my father will never forgive me—and how my only
consolation is in your love—did you know all this,
you would keep me in suspense no longer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her lover was deeply moved by her passionate
entreaties, and pressing her to his bosom, kissed
the tears from her cheek, and soothed her agitation
by those words of kind endearment which are so
eloquent when coming from one we love. He
seemed too about to speak; but if so, he was prevented
by a sudden baying of hounds, mingled with
loud and approaching shouts, and directly a couple
of dogs, followed by three keepers dashed out of the
neighboring copse. Margaret, terrified and agitated,
hastily followed whither her lover pointed, and
retreated into the shadow of a cluster of oaks, followed
by Ruth. She had scarcely done so unperceived,
when the keepers rushed upon her lover,
shouting,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with him—the outlaw—down with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frightened almost out of consciousness, she could
only see that her lover attempted what resistance he
could, and that after a short but fierce contest he
was overpowered, almost unarmed as he was, and
borne to the ground. With all a woman’s devotion
she rushed forward to his protection. But she had
scarcely made a step, before she staggered and
fainted. Ruth, too, was so alarmed as to be of
little service; yet while, with trembling hands, she
assisted to recover her mistress, so fearful was she
of being discovered, that she would scarcely suffer
herself to breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Ruth,” were the first audible words of
her mistress “what have they done with him? Are
they gone? Why did you not try to save him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! dear lady, it would have been in vain,”
said Ruth, mingling her tears with those of her
mistress, “what could I, or both of us have done,
for one who had broken the forest laws?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurried away early on the ensuing morning,
Margaret had no opportunity of learning the fate of
her lover. She only knew that all delusion was at
an end, and that—alas! for her future happiness—she
had bestowed her affections on an outlaw, one
who might soon suffer the penalty of his transgressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On her arrival at Mountfort castle, she learned
that her father had determined to celebrate the approaching
anniversary of her birth, by a tournament
to be given to all comers at his castle. The preparation
for this festivity, though it partially diverted
her mind, could not drive away her melancholy.
Often would she steal away with Ruth, to find a
mournful pleasure in conversing of the happy days
they had spent at her father’s lodge. Such conversations
would generally end in a flood of tears, in
which the tender-hearted hand-maiden would share.
Yet never, not even for one moment, did Margaret
suffer herself to dream of again meeting her lover,
for well she knew that such a thing would call
down upon her the eternal displeasure of her parent.
Let it be recollected that in that age the distinctions
of rank were almost as impassable as the grave.
Nevertheless, the worm had fastened itself upon her
heart, and like thousands before and since, the heiress
found how fearful it was to love without hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the preparations for the tournament
proceeded, and on the morning of the expected day,
crowds thronged to the plain in front of the castle,
on which the lists had been erected. The unrivalled
beauty of the heiress in whose honor the festivities
were to be given, had drawn together the chivalry
of the realm, and a series of courses was expected
to be run such as had not been heard of for years.
But especially every tongue was loud in the praise
of the young Earl of Hastings, who, had just returned
from the Holy land, where he had been since
boyhood, with the reputation of the best lance of
the army. There were many, however, of the competitors
who sneered at his pretensions, and promised
themselves to unhorse him at the first shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Margaret,” said her father, on the morning of
the tournament, “you will see lord Hastings in the
lists to-day, and I wish you to mark him well, for
having heard of you by report, he has solicited your
hand. Such an alliance would raise higher than
ever our noble house. I did not hesitate. But
now never blush, sweet one,—you maidens are ever
thus,—what! in tears. Go to your bower, child,
and get ready for the pageant. Many a proud
dame will envy your lot to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little did the inflexible, though affectionate father
know of the agony he was inflicting on that young
heart. Margaret saw that her doom was sealed,
and she knew her parent too well even to expostulate,
She went to her chamber, but it was to weep.
All hope was over. She had nourished the romantic
idea of continuing faithful to her unhappy lover
by refusing every alliance, never dreaming that her
father would interfere. Short-sighted girl! Already
had he chosen for her, and she knew that the decrees
of fate were less inflexible than her parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, however, she aroused herself and proceeded
to the lists, in all the pomp of the heiress of
her father’s vast possessions. How few knew the
heavy heart which throbbed in agony beneath that
jewelled boddice. The lists were gorgeously fitted
up. A gallery in their centre, opposite to where the
shock of the combatants would take place was appropriated
to Margaret, who was to preside as queen
of the festivities. Around were her father’s countless
guests, numbering half the nobility of the realm,
their wives and daughters flashing with jewels, and
all envying the fortunate being, who, at that moment,
would willingly have exchanged her rank and splendor
for the peasant’s garb, if it came attended by
happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tournament began. Several courses had
been run with various success, when a herald rode
into the lists and proclaimed that three courses yet
remained, all of which Sir Robert De Laney, a
renowned knight, would engage in with any three
combatants, until overpowered or victorious. Several
knights instantly presented themselves. The lot
fell upon three, the Earl of Warren, Sir Edward
Sidney, and lord Hastings. At once the challenger
presented himself for the first antagonist. But
the skill of his opponent was in vain. Lord Warren
was hurled bleeding to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl of Hastings now rode into the lists, and
at his appearance a buzz of admiration ran around
the spectators. His mien, his horsemanship, his
comparative youth, and the renown he had brought
with him from the east, enlisted the popular wish in
his favor. Nor did he disappoint it. At the first
shock he splintered his lance against his antagonist’s
front, while De Laney’s shaft just grazed by him.
The older knight reeled in the saddle, and scarcely
saved himself from falling. A shout of general
applause rewarded the young Earl’s skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there yet remained an equally renowned
competitor with whom to contend. By the laws of
the tournament, Sir Edward Sidney had a right to
contest with the conqueror for the honors of the
day, a privilege of which he instantly signified his
intention of availing himself. With equal readiness
the young Earl prepared for the contest. The combatants
took their places, and after a breathless
hush of an instant the signal was given, and they
vanished from their stations. The shock of their
meeting was like that of an earthquake. The
knight directing his lance full at his adversary’s
breast, aimed to bear him by main force to the
ground, but at the very instant of meeting, the
young Earl bent in the saddle to evade the blow,
and altering the direction of his own lance as he
did so, he bore it full upon the breast of his antagonist,
striking him with such force as to hurl him
from the saddle like a stone from a sling. The
discomfited knight fell heavily to the earth, and was
borne off by his squires; while the victor swept
onward amid the acclamations of the spectators.
The heralds now proclaimed lord Hastings the
conqueror of the day, and led him toward the lady
Margaret to receive the prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can tell her feelings as she beheld the gallant
train approaching? She saw before her, her
destined lover, and however she might have admired
his gallant exploits had her heart been disengaged,
could she—loving another as she did—look upon
him with aught but aversion? But though her emotion
nearly overpowered her, she composed herself
sufficiently to go through with her approaching
duty. As the victor knelt at her feet, what sudden
feeling was it which shot through her bosom? Why
did her cheek crimson, her breath come quick, her
heart flutter wildly? And why, as the helmet was
removed from lord Hastings, did she drop the crown
with which she was to reward him, and with a
half suppressed scream, faint away? Why! but
that in the victor of the tourney she recognised her
own outlaw lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The joy of the reviving maiden when she found
her preserver bending over her, and conjuring her
to speak to him once more and forgive his stratagem,
we shall not attempt to describe. Suffice it to
say that the day of the tourney which opened as
the darkest, set as the brightest, in her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Earl happening to see his mistress
accidentally had imbibed the romantic idea of wooing
her as an unknown and untitled stranger. For this
purpose he had secretly followed her down to the
lodge, and attired in an outlaw’s dress, had hovered
around her path, waiting for a fitting opportunity to
introduce himself. The manner in which he was
at length favored by circumstances, as well as his
subsequent success in his suit, the reader has seen.
But his pretended character was not without its
evils. He was seen, suspected, and captured by the
forest keepers in the way we have described. He
only escaped by revealing his rank. After his recovery
from the wound he had received on that
occasion, he had arrived at lord Mountfort’s castle,
determining to contest the prize in the approaching
tourney, and then reveal himself to his mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a few weeks after the fête, when the
young Earl of Hastings led to the altar the fair
daughter of the house of Mountfort, who never forgot,
in her titled husband, the unknown <span style='font-size:smaller'>OUTLAW
LOVER</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Part III.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>That</span> man,” says Theophrastus, “is justly
called a lover of filthy lucre, to whom the relish
and value of a gain are enhanced by the baseness
of the means that have been employed in its acquisition.”
I had failed in my designs; but my brutal
triumph over the cause of this failure was almost
equal in effect to success. I did not relent; I felt
no remorse; I would have acted the same part
again: parental affection was irrevocably dead. I
enjoyed a kind of secret satisfaction at the awful
result of my violence. A long and lingering illness,
augmented by the horrors of our parting interview,
had brought Valeria to the verge of the grave. She
had given birth to a son. Poverty had sternly asserted
its supremacy over the happiness of the young
couple. Though since the rupture between us had
taken place, I had never visited or enquired about
her, there were many interlopers sufficiently officious
to convey to me news of her approaching dissolution.
These hints I would have disregarded, but
for the sinister reports which from this time forth
were so liberally circulated to my disadvantage. A
note hastily placed in my hands one evening by a
muffled figure, in whom, notwithstanding the attempted
disguise, I fancied I recognised the manly
form and contour of Da Vinci, confirmed me in my
determination to witness the results of my violence.
It was traced in a tremulous hand, and read as
follows:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Father!—for Christian meekness and humanity,
still compel me to call you by the endearing name—will
you not soften your heart toward one, who, by
all the laws of nature and of man, should be its solace
and its idol; and whose last wish is that death should
separate us in amity and mutual affection? Will you
not, now at least, when she, who was once the delight
of your old age, and the comforter of your
bereaved heart, is on the bed of death,—will you not
hearken to her dying wish, and grant the boon she
so eagerly desires? O, have some mercy, my father—my
benefactor! Hasten to the death-bed of your
wretched—wretched daughter! May God forgive
you, is the prayer of your erring</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Valeria</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two motives induced me to comply with the
request contained in this note. First, I was anxious
to avoid the contumely of those who watched
my actions; and secondly, I felt a fiendish desire to
behold the consummation of my revenge. Throwing
a hasty disguise over my person I sallied out, and
rapidly pushed my way through the thoroughfares
of Venice, to a remote part of the city called <span class='it'>Francesco
della Vigna</span>. Here, in an obscure lane, and
surrounded by filth and poverty, I traced my way
to the wretched tenement of Da Vinci and Valeria.
A kind of involuntary sickness came over me as I
ascended the stairs leading to the miserable loft
in which they lodged. It proceeded not from remorse;
it was not prompted by humanity; it was
instinct conquering nature. With some hesitation
I entered the apartment of the dying woman. A
spectacle, which to any one but myself, would
have appeared heart-rending, caused me to shudder
for the immensity of my guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The haggard and wasted form of Valeria was
stretched on the bare floor. Her half-famished
infant lay upon her breast. She breathed with
difficulty. Her eyes were sunken, her complexion
pallid and unearthly. Her features betrayed evidences
of the most intense agony, both mental and
physical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most shocking part of the scene was the
ghastly semblance of Da Vinci, as he sat by the
bed-side of his dying wife. His hands were crossed—his
knees drawn together; his elbows rested on
a broken table; his hair fell in long and matted
locks from his head; his skin was ashy and squalid;
and in place of the manly beauty which every lineament
of his countenance had once betrayed, his
features were now haggard and care-worn, and his
once mellow and intellectual eye, was fixed with an
unmeaning stare on the wretch before him. Three
days had scarcely elapsed since I had recognised
him in the strength and beauty of manhood, but,
oh, how changed! how fallen! how wretched!</p>

<p class='pindent'>On drawing near this afflicted group, I was
startled and alarmed at the change that came
over the countenance of Da Vinci. At first the
bereaved man fixed upon me a stupid and sullen
gaze; but on recognising the author of his misery,
his eyes flashed with maniacal ferocity; his lips
became pale and compressed; the large veins on
his temples swelled, and throbbed violently; and
he exhibited the most alarming symptoms of madness.
I endeavored to draw back; but I was too
late. His deadly purpose was fixed. With a wild,
shrieking laugh he sprang upon me. In an instant
his nails were buried in my neck. I struggled with
desperate energy. Incontinence and debauchery
had sapped my vital principle, and age had laid his
searing hand on my frame; but I contended for
life, and I was powerful. On the other hand, Da
Vinci, nerved by the delirium which had taken possession
of him, was irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiend!” he shouted—“die!—die!—die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will murder me!” I groaned, already suffocating
under his vice-like grasp, “have mercy, for
God’s sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You showed <span class='it'>her</span> none!” he answered hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I repent—I shall make amends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late—she is dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God, stop!—you strangle me! I am not
fit to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better. Die—villain, die!” and
with a desperate exertion he bore me to the floor.
I essayed in vain to release myself from his deadly
grasp. A moment more, and death would have
rescued me; but the Almighty ordained that I
should live to reap the fruits of my crimes. Involuntarily,
as the agonies of dissolution came upon
me, my hand sought one of those small daggers,
with which an Italian is never unprovided. I drew
it from my bosom. I raised it to strike. Da Vinci
saw his danger; but he was too late. With irresistible
strength I plunged it in his side. He uttered
no groan; he rolled from my person a dead man.
I stooped over the bleeding corpse in mute horror.
The eyes were fixed upon me with a glassy gaze.
It was a fearful spectacle—one which was well
calculated to strike awe into the bosom of a murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned a searching eye toward the prostrate
form of my daughter. It was inanimate. No
sign of life or recognition illumined her ghastly
countenance. She had evidently swooned. As if
in mockery of the dreadful tragedy which had just
transpired, the infant boy slumbered peacefully by
her side. The reproach was more than I could
bear. Guilt—guilt was whispered in my ear by a
thousand voices. I rushed from the blood-stained
spot. I hurried to my desolate home. Here new
miseries awaited me, I bolted the doors; but they
afforded me no security. I drank deeply—but inebriation
came not. I endeavored to sleep; but my
horrors were increased. This fearful state drove
me to desperation. I tried to pray: the Almighty
heard me not. My heart was too black—too
guilty. Night had come. My sufferings were too
intense for human endurance. The lonely and
ruinous garret in which I lay, augmented the
dreadful vividness with which I created the most
revolting phantasmas in every recess and corner;
and the hollow moaning of the wind against the
roof filled my soul with ominous and harrowing
sensations. A strange—an indefinable desire to
return to the scene of death, took possession of my
mind. It became too absorbing—too interminable
to be resisted. The moon had by this time ascended
her throne in all her queenliness and majesty. I
rushed rapidly through the empty streets to the
quay for the night-gondoliers; and aided by the
moonlight, soon succeeded in reaching <span class='it'>San Francesco della Vigna</span>.
Hastily dismissing the gondolier,
I won my way to the abode of the dead. An
ominous silence reigned around it. I shuddered—I
turned pale; but I did not hesitate. Up the
tottering stairs I rushed; the door of the death-room
was open; and my eyes at once fell upon a
picture which is indelibly engraved on my memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Valeria had, on recovering her senses, crept to
the body of her husband. She held the slumbering
babe in one arm, while with the other she raised
the head of the dead man and reclined it on her
bosom. She knew he was dead—that he would
never wake again; she saw the life-blood oozing
from his heart; but her devotion was superior to
the evidence of her senses; her constancy to the
sword of death. She chafed his temples; she
fondly smoothed his hair; she kissed again and
again his icy lips; and she fervently prayed for the
salvation of the dead. A pale, unearthly glow was
thrown over the group by occasional glances of the
moon-beams; and everything conspired to strike me
with awe and remorse. But I was not susceptible
of the better feelings of humanity. I possessed no
refined sensibility. Whatever I felt was common
to the lowest of God’s creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” I cried in a hollow voice, “why must
this be? Why must my peace be blasted by such
scenes as these? I murdered him—is it not enough
that he should die? I seek nothing from him after
death. Why—why do you persecute me, Omnipotent
God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See!” shrieked a piercing voice, “see what
you have done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment I could not answer. The anguish
of the accuser deprived me of speech. But at
length I stammered out,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did but defend my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You drove him mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ruined, deceived, beggared me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a calumny!” said Valeria, with flashing
eyes, seeming for an instant to forget her grief in
indignation at the charge, “he honored you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgive him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was silent. The last words were said in a
voice of such exquisite anguish that they went to
my heart—stony as it was. If ever a pang of remorse
vibrated in my soul it was then. Valeria
regarded me with an expression more of sorrow
than of anger. She clasped the infant to her arms
as if it were now her only solace; and burst into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” she murmured, when her agitation had
in some measure subsided; “the hand of death is
upon me. God in his infinite goodness has given
you the means of atonement for your crimes. A
few hours and I shall be no more. Take my child—you
are rich—rich in worldly things—take him,
and have him brought up as he should be. I rely
on you—I beseech you—I command you! You
cannot be so utterly callous to humanity, as to
refuse; let him not die in this miserable place. O,
be kind to him—be more merciful to him than you
were to my poor, dead husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exhausted and heart-broken, the young mother
sank upon the corpse of the murdered man. Her
eyes grew dim; her breathing became short and
violent; her hands and lips seemed bloodless; and
after a few spasms she lay still. I approached her.
I placed my hand upon her heart. Already her
skin was cold and clammy. The sufferer was dead!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chill crept over me as I stooped to examine
the corpse. It seemed as if the ghastly expression
of the countenance was but the effect of some
horrible incubus—so vivid—so real—so revolting
was it to the observer. Fearfully did the presentiment
of future retribution come upon me at that
moment. I was no longer the proud politician,
concerting magnificent schemes; I had nothing left
of the bold and desperate gambler; the greatness of
purpose and energy of execution which had hitherto
marked my career, were at an end. I was now,
what my crimes had made me—an abject, guilty
wretch. I shuddered to think of my awful destination;
I felt how terrible would be the punishment
I so richly merited; but remorse—penitence—sorrow—entered
not my obdurate heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Necessity compelled me to comply with the dying
request of Valeria. I was aware that my conduct
had excited much suspicion. It therefore became
my policy to avoid public attention; and I took the
earliest opportunity to have the unfortunate objects
of my malevolence interred, and the infant orphan
confided to the care of a nurse. No suspicion was
excited at first; but strange things soon began to
be whispered by the individuals who occupied the
lower part of the tenement in which the tragedy had
been enacted. The storm gradually gathered its
forces for a general explosion. Rumors, so liberally
circulated at my expense, reached the ears of the
official authorities under the Doge. Manini was
not predisposed to turn a deaf ear to anything pertaining
to my downfall. His suspicions relative to
my integrity had long been confirmed. Enemies
and interlopers were not wanted to construe every
thing into its most criminal aspect. The result was
such as might be expected. I was arrested by the
city functionaries, on a charge of murder. Universal
horror was expressed when my crimes were
made known. It was evident that I had nothing
to expect from public sympathy.—How many are
there who profess benevolence and charity, ever
ready to persecute the unfortunate with the most
unmitigated severity! I experienced the full effects
of this human failing. My trial was long and
doubtful. Everything in the shape of evidence,
however trivial or absurd, was adduced in order to
convict me. But nothing of a positive nature could
be brought up against me. It was true I had treated
my daughter with severity and inhumanity; but I
could not be found guilty on so general a charge.
It was also true that a noise had been heard in the
apartment of Da Vinci a few hours before his corpse
had been discovered by the lower tenants of the
house; but I was not seen. The whole affair then
though well understood, was in the eye of the law,
uncertain and inconclusive. Public opinion in
a case like mine was not regarded as having
any weight. I was dismissed. My persecutions,
however, did not end so soon. A few devoted
minions of the Doge, glad to have an opportunity
of satisfying their resentment for my former conduct
toward them, followed me unceasingly, and
spared no pains to ensure my self-conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I baffled them. My life, however, became
one of extreme misery and watchfulness. I feared
to sleep lest I should be robbed or assassinated. I
dreaded a sight of the human countenance; for in
every man I fancied I recognised an enemy. Neither
could I hide myself in solitude—my guilt was too
fearful—too relentless. I dared not walk in the
public thoroughfares; for the utmost detestation was
pictured in every face; and my ears were assailed
with reproaches and contumely. I could not roam
the most obscure parts of the city, without being
dogged and persecuted by the blood-hounds of Manini.
It was a miserable situation. Health—comfort—happiness,
were gone forever. Not even the
common enjoyments of life fell to my lot. I could
not sleep—I knew no pleasure in drink—I was
too decrepid and impotent to enjoy artificial stimulants:
what then must have been the depth of my
misery? It was too great to be borne. I resolved
to leave the theatre of my misfortunes; and to bury
myself in the busy haunts of the great English metropolis.
In the costume and character of a Jew,
I embarked for the city of my destination. Arrived
there, I set up a small establishment as a usurer.
My thirst for accumulation was not satisfied by my
crimes; nor did my honesty profit by inaction. The
great object was, however, in some measure effected.
I enjoyed as the guilty may enjoy the security of
my secluded situation. I passed many years in a
state of negative happiness. My internal miseries
lost none of their poignancy; but they caused me
no physical inconvenience. I was free from immediate
conviction; and had every prospect of continuing
unmolested. Time soothed my terrors,
though I still looked forward with fear and anxiety
to the day, when something worse might turn up,
than mere imaginary fears.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Age and imbecility have come upon me. I have
spun out nearly the remains of my guilty existence,
in security and prosperity. I have acquired riches;
but have never enjoyed them. I have sinned and
suffered; but my crimes are not atoned for. A
day will come when the fearful debt must be paid.
I await it with calmness. I repent of nothing that
I have done. I ask forgiveness neither of God nor
of man. Let the full measure of His retribution be
my eternal ruin. I am content to die as I have
lived—fearless—guilty—unrelenting.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Here</span> ends the Autobiography of this false and
evil man. It is a highly-colored, but we trust, not
an extravagant picture of the effects of avarice.
The moral remains to be told. If, in the sequel or
fourth part, we can show that sooner or later retribution
will fall upon the guilty; we may say of our
hero what Scott quotes of Charles the Twelfth:—</p>

<p class='line0'>The sun is rising now, and every spray,</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PARTRIDGE SHOOTING.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>Concluded.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Unless</span> there be continual rain, or it be the depth
of winter, birds will visit their basking place some
time in the course of the day, whether the sun shine
or not. The basking place is generally, but not invariably,
on the sunny side of the hedge. Birds may
be most easily approached in fine weather. All kinds
of birds lie better in small enclosures than in large
ones, that is, when the cover in each is alike. It
need scarcely be added, that the more bushy the
brambles, or the higher the grass the more closely
will lie the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A person who knows how to walk up to a bird will
obtain more shots than one who does not, especially
in windy weather. Birds will not only allow the
shooter to approach nearer to them when he faces
the wind, but they present on rising, a fairer mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the legs of a bird fired at fall, it is almost a
certain proof that it is struck in a vital part. A bird
so struck should be narrowly watched, when, in most
instances, it will be seen, after flying about a hundred
yards if a grouse, or fifty yards if a partridge, to tower
or spire in the air, and fall down dead. When only
one leg falls, the bird should be watched, but in the
latter case, it generally happens that the leg or thigh
only has been struck. Any bird that flinches, on
being fired at, or whose feathers are in the least disordered,
should be marked down, and followed.
Grouse more frequently fly away wounded than partridges.
Grouse are often recovered several hundred
yards from the gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until November or December, young grouse, black-game,
partridges, and pheasants, may be distinguished
from old ones by the lower beak not being strong
enough to bear the weight of their bodies. The
lower beak of an old partridge is strong enough to
sustain the weight of a brace of birds; but a young
bird cannot be raised by the lower beak without the
lower beak bending under the weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of birds in a covey varies much, perhaps
the average may be from ten to fifteen. In
some years, when the coveys are larger after a fine
hatching season, it is not uncommon to see upward
of twenty birds in a covey; and sometimes after a
wet season, ten birds may be deemed a fair covey.
Birds are most numerous after a dry summer. When
there are thunder-storms about midsummer, great
numbers of young birds are drowned. The young
birds have many enemies besides the elements, such
as cats, young dogs, hawks, foxes, and vermin of different
descriptions. When the eggs are taken, or
the young birds destroyed soon after leaving the
shell, there will be a second hatch. Sportsmen often
meet with second hatches in September, when the
old birds rise screaming, and generally alight within
fifty yards, as if to induce the young birds to follow.
In that case the fair sportsman will not fire at the
old birds, but will call in his dogs and leave the
ground. At such times he should look well after the
young dogs, as, when they see the birds running,
they are apt to snatch up such of them as cannot get
out of the way. The very young birds are called
cheepers, from their uttering a scream as they rise.
Full grown birds never scream as they rise, except
when the young ones are helpless, nor do young birds
after they are large enough for the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are shooters who acquire an unsportsman-like
habit of firing at a covey immediately as it rises,
before the birds are fairly on the wing, and, thus
without aiming at any individual bird, bring down
two or three. And sometimes they will make a foul
shot by flanking a covey; the birds being on the
wing, come upon them suddenly, and make a simultaneous
wheel; they take them on the turn, when,
for a moment—and but for a moment—half the covey
are in a line, and floor them rank and file. These are
tricks allied to poaching, and almost as reprehensible
as shooting at birds on the ground, which is nothing
less than high treason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cock partridge is distinguished from the hen
by the brown feathers which form a crescent, or
horse-shoe, as it is sometimes called, on the breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pointer is decidedly the best dog for partridge
shooting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog should fall when the gun is fired, and remain
down until he is told to seek, when he should
point the dead bird. A pointer that drops to shot,
becomes an excellent retriever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog should be taught to obey the eye and the
hand, rather than the voice. A dog that will do so is
invaluable, in open grounds, when birds are wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever speaking to a dog, whether encouragingly
or reprovingly, the sportsman should endeavor
to look what he means, and the dog will understand
him. The dog will understand the look, if he does
not the words. The sportsman should never, with a
smile on his countenance, punish a dog; nor commend
him when he has done well, but with an apparent
hearty good will: the dog will then take an
interest in obeying him.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Night and Morning.” A Novel. By the author
of Pelham, Rienzi, Eugene Aram, &amp;c. 2 vols.
Re-published by Harper &amp; Brothers, New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Right Hon. Charles Leopold Beaufort, of
Beaufort Court, England, a proud and misanthropical
old bachelor, with a rental of twenty thousand pounds,
has two nephews, Philip and Robert Beaufort. The
former, who is the elder of the two, and heir-apparent
to the uncle’s estate, is thoughtless and generous,
with unsteady principles. The latter is a crafty man-of-the-world,
whose only honesty consists in appearing
honest—a scrupulous decorist. Philip, in love
with Catharine Morton, the daughter of a tradesman,
and in fear of his aristocratic uncle’s displeasure, is
married clandestinely, in a remote village of Wales,
by a quondam college friend, to whom he had presented
a living—the Rev. Caleb Price. The better to
keep the secret, a very old Welshman, certain soon
to die, and William Smith, Philip’s servant, are the
sole witnesses of the ceremony. This performed,
Smith is hired to bury himself in Australia until called
for, while the deaf man dies as expected. Some time
having elapsed, Philip, dreading accident to the register,
writes to Caleb for an attested copy of the
record. Caleb is too ill to make it, but employs a
neighboring curate, Morgan Jones, to make and attest
it, and despatches it, just before dying, to Philip, who,
fearing his wife’s impatience of the concealment required,
deposites the document, without her knowledge,
in a secret drawer of a bureau. The register
itself is afterwards accidentally destroyed. Catharine
has soon two children—first Philip, the hero of the
novel, and then Sydney. For their sakes she bravely
endures the stigma upon her character. She continues
to live openly with her husband as his mistress, bearing
her maiden name of Morton; and the uncle,
whose nerves would have been shocked at a mis-alliance,
and who would have disinherited its perpetrator,
winks at what he considers the venial vice. The
old gentleman lives on for sixteen years, and yet no
disclosure is made. At last he dies, bequeathing his
property to his eldest nephew, as was anticipated.
The latter prepares forthwith to own Catharine as
his wife; relates to his brother the facts of the clandestine
marriage; speaks of the secreted document,
without designating the place of deposit; is disbelieved
by that person entirely; mounts his horse to
make arrangements for a second wedding, and for
proving the first; is thrown, breaks his neck, and expires
without uttering a word. Catharine, ignorant
of the secret drawer (although aware that a record
had been secreted), failing to find William Smith, and
trusting her cause to an unskilful lawyer, is unable to
prove her marriage, but in the effort to do so makes
an enemy of Robert Beaufort, who takes possession
of the estate as heir at law. Thus the strict precautions
taken by the father to preserve his secret during
the uncle’s life, frustrate the wife in her attempts to
develop it after his death, and the sons are still considered
illegitimate. This is the pivot of the story.
Its incidents are made up of the struggles of the
young men with their fate, but chiefly of the endeavors
of the elder, Philip, to demonstrate the marriage
and redeem the good name of his mother. This he
finally accomplishes, (after her death, and after a host
of vicissitudes experienced in his own person) by the
accidental return of William Smith, and by the discovery
of an additional witness in Morgan Jones,
who made the extract from the register, and to whom
the rightful heir is guided by this long-sought document
itself, obtained from the hands of Robert Beaufort,
(who had found it in the bureau,) through the
instrumentality of one Fanny, the heroine, and in the
end the wife of the hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not give this as the plot of “Night and
Morning,” but as the ground-work of the plot; which
latter, woven from the incidents above mentioned, is
in itself exceedingly complex. The ground-work, as
will be seen, is of no very original character—it is
even absurdly common-place. We are not asserting
too much when we say that every second novel since
the flood has turned upon some series of hopeless
efforts, either to establish legitimacy, or to prove a
will, or to get possession of a great sum of money
most unjustly withheld, or to find out a ragamuffin of
a father, who had been much better left unfound. But,
saying nothing of the basis upon which this story has
been erected, the story itself is, in many respects,
worthy its contriver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word “plot,” as commonly accepted, conveys
but an indefinite meaning. Most persons think of it
as of simple <span class='it'>complexity</span>; and into this error even so
fine a critic as Augustus William Schlegel has obviously
fallen, when he confounds its idea with that of
the mere <span class='it'>intrigue</span> in which the Spanish dramas of
Cervantes and Calderon abound. But the greatest
involution of incident will not result in plot; which,
properly defined, is <span class='it'>that in which no part can be displaced
without ruin to the whole</span>. It may be described
as a building so dependently constructed, that to
change the position of a single brick is to overthrow
the entire fabric. In this definition and description,
we of course refer only to that infinite perfection
which the true artist bears ever in mind—that unattainable
goal to which his eyes are always directed, but
of the possibility of attaining which he still endeavors,
if wise, to cheat himself into the belief. The reading
world, however, is satisfied with a less rigid construction
of the term. It is content to think that plot a
good one, in which none of the <span class='it'>leading</span> incidents can
be <span class='it'>removed</span> without <span class='it'>detriment</span> to the mass. Here indeed
is a material difference; and in this view of the
case the plot of “Night and Morning” is decidedly
excellent. Speaking comparatively, and in regard to
stories similarly composed, it is one of the best. This
the author has evidently designed to make it. For this
purpose he has taxed his powers to the utmost.
Every page bears marks of excessive elaboration, all
tending to one point—a perfect adaptation of the very
numerous atoms of a very unusually involute story.
The better to attain his object he has resorted to the
expedient of writing his book backwards. This is a
simple thing in itself, but may not be generally understood.
An example will best convey the idea. Drawing
near the <span class='it'>dénouement</span> of his tale, our novelist had
proceeded so far as to render it necessary that means
should be devised for the discovery of the missing
marriage record. This record is in the old bureau—this
bureau is at Fernside, originally the seat of
Philip’s father, but now in possession of one Lord
Lilburne, a member of Robert Beaufort’s family.
Two things now strike the writer—first, that the retrieval
of the hero’s fortune should be brought about
by no less a personage than the heroine—by some
lady who should in the end be his bride—and, secondly,
that this lady must procure access to Fernside. Up
to this period in the narrative, it had been the design
to make Camilla Beaufort, Philip’s cousin, the heroine;
but in such case, the cousin and Lord Lilburne being
friends, the document must have been obtained by
fair means; whereas foul means are the most dramatic.
There would have been no <span class='it'>difficulties</span> to overcome
in introducing Camilla into the house in question.
She would have merely rung the bell and walked in.
Moreover, in getting the paper, she would have had
no chance of getting up a scene. This lady is therefore
dropped as the heroine; Mr. Bulwer retraces his
steps, creates Fanny, brings Philip to love her, and
employs Lilburne, (a courtly villain, invented for all
the <span class='it'>high</span> dirty work, as De Burgh Smith for all the
<span class='it'>low</span> dirty work of the story,) employs Lilburne to abduct
her to Fernside, where the capture of the document
is at length (more dramatically than naturally)
contrived. In short, these latter incidents were
emendations, and their really episodical character is
easily traced by the critic. What appears first in the
published book, was last in the original MS. Many
of the most striking portions of the novel were <span class='it'>interleaved</span>
in the same manner—thus giving to after-thought
that air of premeditation which is so pleasing.
Effect seems to follow cause in the most natural and
in the most provident manner, but, in the true construction,
the cause (and here we commit no bull) is
absolutely brought about by the effect. The many
brief, and seemingly insulated chapters met with in
the course of the narrative, are the interposed after-thoughts
in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So careful has been our author in this working-up
of his story—in this nice dovetailing of its constituent
parts—that it is difficult to detect a blemish in any
portion. What he has intended to do he has done
well; and his main intention, as we have before
hinted, was <span class='it'>perfection of plot</span>. A few defects, indeed,
we note; and note them chiefly to show the
skill with which that narrative is wrought, where
such blemishes are the sole ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, there are some descriptive passages
such as the love adventures of Caleb Price, the
account of Gawtrey’s early life, prefaced by that of
his grandfather, and the dinner-scene at Love’s, which
scarcely come within the category of matters tending
to develop the main events. These things, in short,
might have been omitted with advantage (because
without detriment) to the whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 254, vol. 2, we perceive the first indications
of slovenliness, (arising no doubt from the writer’s
anxiety to conclude his task) in an incident
utterly without aim, and composed at random. We
mean the relapse of Philip into a second illness when
nursed by Fanny through the first, at the house of old
Gawtrey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 21, vol. 1, we are told that Caleb Price,
having received from his friend Beaufort a certain
letter (whose contents would have been important
in the subsequent attempts to establish Catharine’s
claim) held it over the flame of the candle, and that
“as the paper dropped on the carpetless floor, Mr.
Jones prudently set thereon the broad sole of his
boot, and the maid servant brushed it into the grate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, trample it out; hurry it among the ashes.
The last as the rest,” said Caleb, hoarsely. “Friendship,
fortune, hope, love, life—a little flame—and then—and then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Don’t be uneasy—it’s quite out</span>,” said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this is related with much emphasis; and, upon
reading it, we resolved to hold in memory that this
important paper, although torn, was still unburned,
and that its fragments had been thrown into a vacant
grate. In fact, it was the design of the novelist to
re-produce these fragments in the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>—a design
which he has forgotten to carry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have defined the word “plot,” in a definition
of our own to be sure, but in one which we do not
the less consider substantially correct; and we have
said that it has been a main point with Mr. Bulwer in
this his last novel, “Night and Morning,” to work up
his plot as near perfection as possible. We have asserted,
too, that his design is well accomplished; but
we do not the less assert that it has been conceived
and executed in error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest of plot, referring, as it does, to cultivated
thought in the reader, and appealing to considerations
analogous with those which are the
essence of sculptural taste, is by no means a popular
interest; although it has the peculiarity of being appreciated
in its atoms by all, while in its totality of
beauty it is comprehended but by the few. The
pleasure which the many derive from it is disjointed,
ineffective, and evanescent; and even in the case of
the critical reader it is a pleasure which may be purchased
too dearly. A good tale maybe written without
it. Some of the finest fictions in the world have
neglected it altogether. We see nothing of it in Gil
Blas, in the Pilgrim’s Progress, or in Robinson Crusoe.
Thus it is not an essential in story-telling at all;
although, well-managed, within proper limits, it is a
thing to be desired. At best it is but a secondary and
rigidly artistical merit, for which no merit of a higher
class—no merit founded in nature—should be sacrificed.
But in the book before us <span class='it'>much</span> is sacrificed
for its sake, and every thing is rendered subservient
to its purposes. So excessive is, here, the involution
of circumstances, that it has been found impossible
to dwell for more than a brief period upon any particular
one. The writer seems in a perpetual flurry
to accomplish what, in autorical parlance, is called
“bringing up one’s time.” He flounders in the vain
attempt to keep all his multitudinous incidents at one
and the same moment before the eye. His ability
has been sadly taxed in the effort—but more sadly the
time and temper of the reader. No sooner do we
begin to take some slight degree of interest in some
cursorily-sketched event, than we are hurried off to
some other, for which a new feeling is to be built up,
only to be tumbled down, forthwith, as before. And
thus, since there is no sufficiently continuous scene
in the whole novel, it results that there is not a
strongly effective one. Time not being given us in
which to become absorbed, we are only permitted to
admire, while we are not the less chilled, tantalised,
wearied, and displeased. Nature, with natural interest,
has been given up a bond-maiden to an elaborate,
but still to a misconceived, perverted, and most unsatisfactory
Art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very little reflection might have sufficed to convince
Mr. Bulwer that narratives, even one fourth so long
as the one now lying upon our table, are <span class='it'>essentially</span>
inadapted to that nice and complex adjustment of incident
at which he has made this desperate attempt.
In the wire-drawn romances which have been so long
fashionable, (God only knows how or why) the pleasure
we derive (if any) is a composite one, and made
up of the respective sums of the various pleasurable
sentiments experienced in perusal. Without excessive
and fatiguing exertion, inconsistent with legitimate
interest, the mind cannot comprehend at one
time, and in one survey, the numerous individual
items which go to establish the whole. Thus the
high ideal sense of the <span class='it'>unique</span> is sure to be wanting:—for,
however absolute in itself be the unity of the
novel, it must inevitably fail of appreciation. We
speak now of that species of unity which is alone
worth the attention of the critic—the unity or totality
<span class='it'>of effect</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we could never bring ourselves to attach any
idea of merit to mere <span class='it'>length</span> in the abstract. A long
story does not appear to us necessarily twice as good
as one only half so long. The ordinary talk about
“continuous and sustained effort” is pure twaddle
and nothing more. Perseverance is one thing and
genius is another—whatever Buffon or Hogarth may
assert to the contrary—and notwithstanding that, in
many passages of the dogmatical literature of old
Rome, such phrases as “<span class='it'>diligentia maxima</span>,” “<span class='it'>diligentia
mirabilis</span>,” can be construed only as “great
talent” or “wonderful ability.” Now if the author
of “Ernest Maltravers,” implicitly following authority
like <span class='it'>les moutons de Panurge, will</span> persist in writing
long romances because long romances have been
written before—if, in short, he cannot be satisfied
with the brief tale (a species of composition which
admits of the highest development of artistical power
in alliance with the wildest vigor of imagination)—he
must then content himself, perforce, with a more
simply and more rigidly narrative form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here, could he see these comments upon a
work which, (estimating it, as is the wont of all artists
of his calibre, by the labor which it has cost
him,) he considers his <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span>, he would assure
us, with a smile, that it is precisely because the book
is <span class='it'>not</span> narrative, and <span class='it'>is</span> dramatic, that he holds it in so
lofty an esteem. Now in regard to its being dramatic,
we should reply that, so far as the radical and ineradicable
<span class='it'>deficiencies</span> of the drama go—it is. This continual
and vexatious shifting of scene, with a view of
bringing up events to the time being, originated at a
period when books were not; and in fact, had the
drama not preceded books, it might never have succeeded
them—we might, and probably should, never
have had a drama at all. By the frequent “bringing
up” of his events the dramatist strove to supply, as
well as he could, the want of the combining, arranging,
and especially of the <span class='it'>commenting</span> power, now in
possession of the narrative author. No doubt it was
a deep but vague sense of this want which brought
into birth the Greek chorus—a thing altogether apart
from the drama itself—<span class='it'>never</span> upon the stage—and
representing, or personifying, the expression of the
sympathy of the audience in the matters transacted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In brief, while the drama of colloquy, vivacious and
breathing of life, is well adopted into narration, the
drama of action and passion will always prove, when
employed beyond due limits, a source of embarrassment
to the narrator, and it can afford him, at best,
nothing which he does not already possess in full
force. We have spoken upon this head much at
length; for we remember that, in some preface to one
of his previous novels, (some preface in which he
endeavored to pre-reason and pre-coax us into admiration
of what was to follow—a bad practice,) Mr.
Bulwer was at great pains to insist upon the peculiar
merits of what he even then termed the dramatic
conduct of his story. The simple truth was that,
then as now, he had merely concentrated into his
book all the <span class='it'>necessary evils</span> of the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giving up his attention to the one point upon which
we have commented, our novelist has failed to do
himself justice in others. The overstrained effort at
perfection of plot has seduced him into absurd sacrifices
of verisimilitude, as regards the connexion of
his <span class='it'>dramatis personæ</span> each with each, and each with
the main events. However incidental be the appearance
of any personage upon the stage, this personage
is sure to be linked in, will I nill I, with the
matters in hand. Philip, on the stage-coach, for example,
converses with but one individual, William
Gawtrey; yet this man’s fate (not subsequently but
previously) is interwoven into that of Philip himself,
through the latter’s relationship to Lilburne. The
hero goes to his mother’s grave, and there comes in
contact with this Gawtrey’s father. He meets Fanny,
and Fanny happens to be also involved in his <span class='it'>destiny</span>
(a pet word, conveying a pet idea of the author’s)
through <span class='it'>her</span> relationship to Lilburne. The witness
in the case of his mother’s marriage is missing, and
this individual turns up at last in the brother of that
very Charles De Burgh Smith with whom so perfectly
accidental an intimacy has already been established.
The wronged heir proceeds at random to look for a
lawyer, and stumbles at once upon the precise one
who had figured before in the story, and who knows
all about previous investigations. Setting out in
search of Liancourt, the first person he sees is that
gentleman himself. Entering a horse-bazaar in a
remote portion of the country, the steed up for sale at
the exact moment of his entrance is recognised as the
pet of his better days. Now our quarrel with these
coincidences is not that they sometimes, but that they
everlastingly occur, and that nothing occurs besides.
We find no fault with Philip for chancing, at the
identically proper moment, upon the identical men,
women, and horses necessary for his own ends and
the ends of the story—but we do think it excessively
hard that he should <span class='it'>never happen upon anything else</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In delineation of character, our artist has done little
worth notice. His highest merit in this respect is,
with a solitary exception, the negative one of not
having subjected himself to dispraise. Catharine and
Camilla are—pretty well in their way. Philip is very
much like all other heroes—perhaps a little more
stiff, a little more obstinate, and a little more desperately
unlucky than the generality of his class. Sydney
is drawn with truth. Plaskwith, Plimmins, and
the Mortons, just sufficiently caricatured, are very
good outline copies from the shaded originals of
Dickens. Of Gawtrey—father and son,—of De Burgh
Smith, of Robert Beaufort and of Lilburne, what is
it possible to say, except that they belong to that
extensive firm of Gawtrey, Smith, Beaufort, Lilburne
and company, which has figured in every novel since
the days of Charles Grandison, and which is doomed
to the same eternal configuration till romance-writing
shall be no more?</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Fanny the author distinctly avows a partiality;
and he does not err in his preference. We have
observed, in some previous review, that <span class='it'>original</span> characters,
so called, can only be critically praised as
such, either when presenting qualities known in real
life, but never before depicted (a combination nearly
impossible) or when presenting qualities which,
although unknown, or even known to be hypothetical,
are so skilfully adapted to the circumstances around
them, that our sense of fitness is not offended, and we
find ourselves seeking a reason why those things
<span class='it'>might not have been</span> which we are still satisfied <span class='it'>are
not</span>. Fanny appertains to this latter class of originality—which
in itself belongs to the loftier regions of
<span class='it'>the Ideal</span>. Her first movements in the story, before
her conception (which we have already characterized
as an after-thought) had assumed distinct shape in the
brain of the author, are altogether ineffective and
frivolous. They consist of the unmeaning affectation
and rhodomontade with which it is customary to
invest the lunatic in common-place fiction. But the
subsequent effects of love upon her mental development
are finely imagined and richly painted; and,
although reason teaches us their impossibility, yet it
is sufficient for the purposes of the artist that fancy
delights in believing them possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bulwer has been often and justly charged with
defects of <span class='it'>style</span>; but the charges have been sadly deficient
in specification, and for the most part have
confounded the idea of mere language with that of
style itself, although the former is no more the latter,
than an oak is a forest, or than a word is a thought.
Without pausing to define what a little reflection will
enable any reader to define for himself, we may say
that the chief constituent of a good style (a constituent
which, in the case of Washington Irving, has been
mistaken for the thing constituted) is what artists
have agreed to denominate <span class='it'>tone</span>. The writer who,
varying this as occasion may require, well adapts it to
the fluctuations of his narrative, accomplishes an
important object in style. Mr. Bulwer’s tone is
always correct; and so great is the virtue of this quality
that he can scarcely be termed, upon the whole, a
bad stylist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mere English is grossly defective—turgid, involved,
and ungrammatical. There is scarcely a
page of “Night and Morning” upon which a school-boy
could not detect at least half a dozen instances
of faulty construction. Sentences such as this are
continually occurring—“And at last silenced, if not
convinced, his eyes closed, and the tears yet wet upon
their lashes, fell asleep.” Here, strictly speaking, it
is the eyes which “fell asleep,” and which were
“silent if not convinced.” The pronoun, “he,” is
wanting for the verb “fell.” The whole would read
better thus—“And at last, silent, if not convinced, he
closed his eyes, and fell asleep with the tears yet
on the lashes.” It will be seen that, besides other
modifications, we have changed “upon” into “on,”
and omitted “wet” as superfluous when applied to
tear; who ever heard of a dry one? The sentence in
question, which occurs at page 83, vol. 1, was the
first which arrested our attention on opening the
book at random; but its errors are sufficiently illustrative
of the <span class='it'>character</span> of those faults of phraseology
in which the work abounds, and which have arisen,
not so much through carelessness, as from a peculiar
bias in the mind of the writer, leading him, per force,
into <span class='it'>involution</span>, whether here in style, or elsewhere in
plot. The beauty of simplicity is not that which can
be appreciated by Mr. Bulwer; and whatever may be
the true merits of his intelligence, the merit of luminous
and precise thought is evidently not one of the
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 194, vol. 1, we have this—“I am not
what you seem to suppose—exactly a swindler, certainly
not a robber.” Here, to make himself intelligible,
the speaker should have repeated the words “I
am not,” before “exactly.” As it stands, the sentence
does not imply that “I am not exactly a
swindler, &amp;c.” but (if anything) that the person addressed,
imagined me to be certainly not a robber but
exactly a swindler—an implication which it was not
intended to convey. Such awkwardness in a practised
writer would be inconceivable, did we not refer in
memory to that moral bias of which we have just
spoken. Our readers will of course examine the
English of “Night and Morning” for themselves.
From the evidence of one or two sentences we cannot
expect them to form a judgment in the premises.
Dreading indeed the suspicion of unfairness, we had
pencilled item after item for comment—but we have
abandoned the task in despair. It would be an endless
labor to proceed with examples. In fact it is
folly to particularize where the blunders would be
the rule, and the grammar the exception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Lytton has one desperate mannerism of which
we would be glad to see him well rid—a fashion of
beginning short sentences, after very long ones, with
the phrase “So there,” or something equivalent, and
this too, when there is no sequence in the matter to
warrant the use of the word “So.” Thus, at page
136, vol. I,—“So there they sat on the cold stone,
these two orphans;” at page 179,—“So there by the
calm banks of the placid lake, the youngest born of
Catharine passed his tranquil days,”—and just below,
on the same page,—“So thus was he severed from
both his protectors, Arthur and Philip;” and at page
241, vol. II,—“So there sat the old man,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—and
in innumerable other instances throughout the
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the <span class='it'>niäiseries</span> of his style we may mention
the coxcombical use of little French sentences, without
the shadow of an excuse for their employment.
At page 22, vol. 2, in the scene at the counterfeiter’s
cellar, what can be more nonsensical than Gawtrey’s
“<span class='it'>C’est juste; buvez donc, cher ami</span>,”—“<span class='it'>C’est juste;
buvez donc, vieux rénard</span>,”—and “<span class='it'>Ce n’est pas vrai;
buvez donc Monsieur Favart?</span>” Why should these
platitudes be alone given in French, when it is obvious
that the entire conversation was carried on in that
tongue? And, again, when, at page 49, Fanny exclaims—“<span class='it'>Méchant</span>,
every one dies to Fanny!”—why
could not this heroine have as well confined herself
to one language? At page 38, the climax of absurdity,
in this respect, is fairly capped; and it is difficult to
keep one’s countenance, when we read of a Parisian
cobbler breathing his last in a garret, and screaming
out “<span class='it'>Je m’étouffe</span>—Air!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever a startling incident is recorded, our
novelist seems to make it a point of conscience that
somebody should “fall insensible.” Thus at page
172, vol. 1,—“ ‘My brother, my brother, they have
taken thee from me,’ cried Philip, and he fell insensible,”—and
at page 38, vol. 2, “ ‘I was unkind to him
at the last,’ and with these words she fell upon the
corpse insensible,” &amp;c. &amp;c. There is a great deal too
much of this. An occasional swoon is a thing of no
consequence, but “even Stamboul must have an end,”
and Mr. Bulwer should make an end of his syncopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again. That gentlemen and ladies, when called
upon to give alms, or to defray some trifling incidental
expense, are in the invariable habit of giving the
whole contents of their purses without examination,
and, moreover, of “throwing” the purse into the
bargain, is an idea most erroneously entertained. At
page 55, vol. 1, we are told that Philip, “as he spoke,
<span class='it'>slid</span> his purse into the woman’s hand.” At page 110,
“a hint for money restored Beaufort to his recollection,
and he <span class='it'>flung</span> his purse into the nearest hand
outstretched to receive it.” At page 87, “Lilburne
<span class='it'>tossed</span> his purse into the hands of his valet, whose
face seems to lose its anxious embarrassment at the
touch of the gold.” It is true that the “anxious embarrassment”
of any valet out of a novel, would have
been rather increased than diminished by having a
purse of gold tossed at his head—but what we wish
our readers to observe, is that magnificent contempt
of filthy lucre with which the characters of Sir Edward
Lytton Bulwer “fling,” “slide,” “toss,” and tumble
whole purses of money about!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the predominant and most important failing of
the author of “Devereux,” in point of style, is an absolute
mania for metaphor—metaphor always running
into allegory. Pure allegory is at all times an abomination—a
remnant of antique barbarism—appealing
only to our faculties of comparison, without even a
remote interest for our reason, or for our fancy.
Metaphor, its softened image, has indisputable force
when sparingly and skilfully employed. Vigorous
writers use it rarely indeed. Mr. Bulwer is all metaphor
or all allegory—mixed metaphor and unsustained
allegory—and nothing if neither. He cannot express
a dozen consecutive sentences in an honest and manly
manner. He is the king-coxcomb of figures-of-speech.
His rage for personification is really ludicrous. The
simplest noun becomes animate in his hands. Never,
by any accident, does he write even so ordinary a
word as time, or temper, or talent, without the capital
T. Seldom, indeed, is he content with the dignity
and mysticism thus imposed;—for the most part it is
<span class='sc'>Time</span>, <span class='sc'>Temper</span> and <span class='sc'>Talent</span>. Nor does the common-place
character of anything which he wishes to
personify exclude it from the prosopopeia. At page
256, volume 1, we have some profound rigmarole, seriously
urged, about piemen crying “all hot! all hot!”
“in the ear of Infant and Ragged Hunger,” thus
written; and, at page 207, there is something positively
transcendental all about LAW—a very little thing
in itself, in some cases—but which Mr. Bulwer, in
his book, has thought proper to make quite as big as
we have printed it above. Who cannot fancy him, in
the former instance, saying to himself, as he gnaws
the top of his quill, “that is a fine thought!” and exclaiming
in the latter, as he puts his finger to the side
of his nose, “ah, how <span class='it'>very</span> fine an idea that is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This absurdity, indeed, is chiefly observable in
those philosophical discussions with which he is in
the wicked habit of interspersing his fictions, and
springs only from a rabid anxiety to look wise—to
appear profound—even when wisdom is quite out of
place, and profundity the quintessence of folly. A
“still small voice” has whispered in his ear that, as
to the real matter of fact, <span class='it'>he is shallow</span>—a whisper
which he does not intend to believe, and which, by
dint of loud talking in parables, he hopes to prevent
from reaching the ears of the public. Now, in truth,
the public, great-gander as it is, is content to swallow
his romance without much examination, but cannot
help turning up its nose at his logic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men of sense,” says Helvetius, “those idols
of the unthinking, are very inferior to the men of
passions. It is the strong passions which, rescuing us
from Sloth, can alone impart to us that continuous
and earnest attention necessary to great intellectual
efforts”—Understanding the word “efforts” in its
legitimate force, and not confounding it altogether
with achievements, we may well apply to Mr. Bulwer
the philosopher’s remark, thence deducing the secret
of his success as a novelist. He is emphatically the
man “of passions.” With an intellect rather well
balanced than lofty, he has not full claim to the title
of a man of genius. Urged by the burning desire of
doing much, he has certainly done something. Elaborate
even to fault, he will never write a bad book, and
has once or twice been upon the point of concocting
a good one. It is the custom to call him a fine
writer, but in doing so we should judge him less by
an artistical standard of excellence, than by comparison
with the drivellers who surround him. To Scott
he is altogether inferior, except in that mock and
tawdry philosophy which the Caledonian had the
discretion to avoid, and the courage to contemn. In
pathos, humour, and verisimilitude he is unequal to
Dickens; surpassing him only in general knowledge,
and in the sentiment of Art. Of James he is more
than the equal at all points. While he could never
fall as low as D’Israeli has occasionally fallen, neither
himself, nor any of those whom we have mentioned,
have ever risen nearly so high as that very
gifted and very extraordinary man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In regard to “Night and Morning” we cannot
agree with that critical opinion which considers it
the best novel of its author. It is only not his worst.
It is not as good as Eugene Aram, nor as Rienzi—and
is not at all comparable with Ernest Maltravers.
Upon the whole it is a good book. Its merits beyond
doubt overbalance its defects, and if we have not
dwelt upon the former with as much unction as upon
the latter, it is because the Bulwerian beauties are
precisely of that secondary character which never
fails of the fullest public appreciation.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Sketches of Conspicuous Living Characters of
France.” Translated by R. M. Walsh. Lea and
Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The public are much indebted to Mr. Walsh for
this book, which is one of unusual interest and value.
It is a translation from the French, of fifteen biographical
and critical sketches, written, and originally
published in weekly numbers at Paris, by some one
who styles himself “<span class='it'>un homme de rien</span>”—the better
to conceal the fact, perhaps, that he is really un
<span class='it'>homme de beaucoup</span>. Whatever, unhappily, may be
the case with ourselves, or in England, it is clear
that in the capital of France, at least,—that hot-bed
of journalism, and Paradise of journalists—nobody
has any right to call himself “nobody,” while wielding
so vigorous and vivacious a pen as the author of
these articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are told in the Preface to the present translation
that they met with the greatest success, upon
their first appearance, and were considered by the
Parisians as perfectly authentic in their statement of
facts, and “as impartial in their appreciation of the
different personages sketched as could be desired.”
“As impartial, &amp;c.” means, we presume, entirely so;
for in matters of this kind an absolute impartiality,
of course, is all, but still the least “that could be
desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Walsh farther assures us that Châteaubriand
wrote the author a letter “of a highly complimentary
tenor” which was published, but of which the translator,
“unfortunately, does not happen to have a copy
in his possession.” A more unfortunate circumstance
is that Mr. W. should have thought it necessary to
bolster a book which needs no bolstering, by the
authority of any name, however great; and the most
unfortunate thing of all, so far as regards the weight
of the authority, is that Châteaubriand himself is belauded
<span class='it'>ad nauseam</span> in those very pages to the inditer
of which he sent that letter of the “complimentary
tenor.” When any body shall puff <span class='it'>us</span>, as this Mr.
Nobody has bepuffed the author of <span class='it'>The Martyrs</span>, we
will send them a letter “of a complimentary tenor”
too. We do not mean to decry the general merit of
the book, or the candor of him who composed it. We
wish merely to observe that Châteaubriand, under the
circumstances, cannot be received as evidence of
the one, nor his biography as instance of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These sketches of men now playing important
parts in the great drama of French affairs would be
interesting, if only from their subjects. We have
here biographies, (sufficiently full) of Thiers, Châteaubriand,
Laffitte, Guizot, Lamartine, Soult, Berryer,
De La Mennais, Hugo, Dupin, Béranger, Odillon
Barrot, Arago, George Sand, and the Duke De
Broglie. We are most pleased with those of Thiers,
Hugo, Sand, Arago, and Béranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among many good stories of Thiers, this is told.
A prize had been offered by the Academy of Aix for
the best eulogium on Vauvenargues. Thiers, then
quite a boy, sent a M. S. It was deemed excellent;
but the author being suspected, and no other candidate
deserving the palm, the committee, rather than
award it to a Jacobin, postponed their decision for a
year. At the expiration of this time our youth’s
article again made its appearance, but, meanwhile, a
production had arrived from Paris which was thought
far better. The judges were rejoiced. They were
no longer under the cruel necessity of giving the first
honor to a Jacobin—but felt bound to present him
with the second. The name of the Parisian victor
was unsealed. It was that of Thiers—Monsieur
Tonson come again. He had been at great pains to
mystify the committee; (other committees of the same
kind more frequently reverse affairs and mystify the
public) the M. S. had been copied in a strange hand,
and been sent from Aix to Paris and from Paris to
Aix. Thus our little friend obtained both the main
prize and the <span class='it'>accessit</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An anecdote somewhat similar is related of Victor
Hugo. In 1817, the Academy offered a premium for
the best poem on the advantages of study. Hugo
entered the lists. His piece was considered worthiest,
but was rejected because a falsehood was supposed to
be implied in the concluding lines, which ran thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Moi qui, toujours fuyant les cités et les cours,</p>
<p class='line0'>De trois lustres à peine ai vu finir le cours.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Academy would not believe that any one under
twenty-five years of age had written so fine a poem,
and, supposing a mystification designed, thought to
punish the author by refusing him the prize. Informed
of the facts, Hugo hastened to show the certificate
of his birth to the reporter, M. Raynouard; but
it was too late—the premium had been awarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Laffitte many remarkable incidents are narrated
evincing the noble liberality of his disposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the notice of Berryer it is said that, a letter
being addressed by the Duchess of Berry to the legitimists
of Paris, to inform them of her arrival, it was
accompanied by a long note in cypher, the key of
which she had forgotten to give. “The penetrating
mind of Berryer,” says our biographer, “soon discovered
it. It was this phrase substituted for the
twenty-four letters of the alphabet—<span class='it'>Le gouvernement
provisoire</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this is very well as an anecdote; but we cannot
understand the extraordinary penetration required in
the matter. The phrase “<span class='it'>Le gouvernement provisoire</span>”
is French, and the note in cypher was addressed
to Frenchmen. The difficulty of decyphering
may well be supposed much greater had the key been
in a foreign tongue; yet any one who will take the
trouble may address us a note, in the same manner
as here proposed, and the key-phrase may be either
in French, Italian, Spanish, German, Latin or Greek,
(or in any of the dialects of these languages), and we
pledge ourselves for the solution of the riddle. The
experiment may afford our readers some amusement—let
them try it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we are rambling from our theme. The genius
of Arago is finely painted, and the character of his
quackery put in a true light. The straight-forward,
plainly-written critical comments upon this philosopher,
as well as upon George Sand, and that absurd
antithesis-hunter, Victor Hugo, please us far more
than that mere cant and rhapsody in which the
biographer involves himself when speaking of Châteaubriand
and Lamartine. We have observed that
all great authors who fall occasionally into the sins of
ranting and raving, meet with critics who think the
only way to elucidate, is to out-rant and out-rave
them. A beautiful confusion of thought of course
ensues, which it is truly refreshing to contemplate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The account of George Sand (Madame Dudevant)
is full of piquancy and spirit. The writer, by dint of
a little chicanery, obtained access, it seems, to her
boudoir, with an opportunity of sketching her in
dishabille. He found her in a gentleman’s frock
coat, smoking a cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of the equivocal costume affected by this
lady, Mr. Walsh, in a foot-note, comments upon a
nice distinction made once by a soldier on duty at the
Chamber of Deputies. Madame D., habited in male
attire, was making her way into the gallery, when
the man, presenting his musket before her, cried out
“<span class='it'>Monsieur</span>, les <span class='it'>dames</span> ne passent pas par ici!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we regret that our space will not allow us to cull
even a few of the good things with which the book
abounds. The whole volume is exceedingly <span class='it'>piquant</span>,
and replete with that racy wit which is so peculiarly
French as to make us believe it a consequence of the
<span class='it'>tournure</span> of the language itself. But if a Frenchman
is invariably witty, he is not the less everlastingly
bombastic; and these memoirs are decidedly French.
What can we do but smile when we hear any one talk
about Châteaubriand’s <span class='it'>Essay upon English Poetry</span>,
with his <span class='it'>Translation of Milton</span>! as a task which he
alone was qualified to execute!—or when we read
page after page in which Lamartine is discoursed of
as “a noble child, with flaxen locks,” “disporting
upon the banks of the Seine,” “picking up Grecian
lyres dropped by the mild Chenier,” “enriching them
with Christian chords,” and “ravishing the world
with new melodies!” What can we do but laugh outright
at such phrases as the “sympathetic swan-like
cries,” and the “singular lyric precocity of the crystal
soul”—of such an ass as the author of Bug-Jargal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as mere translation goes, the volume now
before us is, in some respects, not very well done.
Too little care has been taken in rendering the French
idioms by English equivalents; and, because a French
writer, through the impulses of his vivacity, cannot
avoid telling, in the present tense, a story of the past,
it does not follow that such a misusage of language
is consonant with the graver genius of the Saxon.
Mr. Walsh is always too literal, although sufficiently
correct. He should not employ, however, even in
translation, such queer words as “to legitimate,”
meaning “to legitimatize,” or “to fulmine,” meaning
“to fulminate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At page 211, the force of the compound “<span class='it'>l’homme-calembourg</span>”
is not conveyed by the words “<span class='it'>the</span> punster,”
even when we italicize <span class='it'>the</span>. <span class='it'>The walking-pun</span>,
perhaps, is an analogous phrase which might be more
properly employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is some odd mistake at page 274, where the
translator speaks of measuring the diameter of the
earth by measuring its <span class='it'>rays</span>. We presume the word
in the original is <span class='it'>rayons</span>; if so we can only translate
it by the Latin <span class='it'>radii</span>. No doubt a radius, literally, is
a ray; but science has its own terms, and <span class='it'>will</span> employ
them. We should like to see either Mr. Walsh or
Monsieur Arago (or both together) trying to measure
a <span class='it'>ray</span> of the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mechanical execution of the book is good,
saving a thousand outrageous typographical blunders,
and <span class='it'>that</span> lithograph of Thiers. We have no doubt in
the world that this gentleman (who ran away during
the three days and hid himself in the woods of Montmorency),
is a somewhat dirty, insignificant little
fellow, and so be it; but we will never be brought to
believe that any individual in Christendom ever did or
could look half as saucy, or as greasy, as does “Monsieur
Mirabeau-mouche” in that picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The design of this book is among the number of

are <span class='it'>not</span> among the best—but we should have had the
<span class='it'>Dii majorum gentium</span> exclusively—one paper from
each. These papers, too, should have been written
with some uniformity of manner, or of plan, and
have confined themselves to racy and truthful delineation
of that character which is <span class='it'>peculiarly</span> British,
while the engravings should have been careful
embodiments of the text. As it is, the publication
has something of a hap-hazard, and, if the truth must
be told, of a catchpenny air, which makes very much
against it, notwithstanding the exceeding merit of
several of the essays, and of three or four of the
designs. The preface seems to have been written by
some one who had a proper sense of what the volume
<span class='it'>should be</span>, but affords no indication of what it really <span class='it'>is</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are twenty-six “Heads” in all. Some of
them are pure caricatures without merit—“The Creditor,”
for example, and “The Debtor,” (injudiciously
placed as frontispieces), The “Diner-Out,” The
“Sentimental Singer,” “The Man of Many Goes”
and “The Printer’s Devil.” Others are equally
caricatures, but of so vivid and truth-preserving an
exaggeration, that we admire without scruple:—we
allude to “The Lion of the Party,” “The Waiter,”
“The Linen-Draper’s Assistant” and “The Stock-Broker.”
Some are full of natural truth—for instance
“The Young Lord,” “The Dress-Maker,” “The
Young Squire,” “The Basket Woman,” “Captain
Rook” and “Mr. Pigeon.” “The Last Go” is the best
thing in the volume—combining the extreme of the
ludicrous with absolute fidelity. “The Fashionable
Authoress,” “The Cockney” and “The Family
Governess” are tame and unmeaning. The rest have
no particular merit or demerit. About the whole
there is a great deal of bad drawing, which we know
not whether to attribute to the designer or engraver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same variety of value is observable in the text.
In general the articles are not very creditable; although
one or two are of surpassing excellence. The
longest called “Tavern Heads” (illustrated by seven
or eight sketches) is a rambling, disjointed narrative
in imitation of Dickens, and written probably by the
author of a clever production entitled “Pickwick
Abroad,” never yet republished, we believe, in this
country. The paper called “Captain Rook and Mr.
Pigeon,” and superscribed with the name of William
Thackeray, is one of the finest specimens of easily-mingled
humor and wit we have ever had the pleasure
of perusing.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“The Flying Dutchman.” By the author of Gentleman
Jack. 2 vols. Carey &amp; Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The legend of the Flying Dutchman has long since
been worn out, and its attempted resuscitation by this
author has, as he should have known, proved an
entire failure. Indeed we have rarely read a less
creditable novel than this. The characters are
strange; the incidents unnatural; and the descriptions
of the mighty deep surpassed by nine out of ten of
our ordinary sea-writers. The tyranny which formerly
existed, and indeed still exists in a measure, in
the British navy is, however, sketched with a bold
pencil; but with this single redeeming trait, the public,
much less the critics, will scarcely be satisfied.
The desertion of Ramsay on the Island; his miraculous
meeting with the very one he wished to meet,
Angela; the whole farcical story, of the deception
practised in the appearance of the Flying Dutchman’s
frigate; the singular preservation of Capt. Livingston
from drowning, when cast overboard unseen at night;
and the clap-trap of the trial scene, when the aforesaid
captain and the corporal appear so unexpectedly,
furnish a series of improbabilities only to be endured
by a novel-reader of sufficient voracity to gorge,
shark-like, any and everything, no matter what.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Patchwork.” By Capt. Basil Hall. 2 vols. Lea &amp;
Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Hall is one of the most agreeable of
writers. We like him for the same reason that we
like a good drawing-room conversationist—there is
such a pleasure in listening to his elegant nothings.
Not that the captain is unable to be profound. He
has, on the contrary, some reputation for science.
But in his hands even the most trifling personal adventures
become interesting from the very piquancy
with which they are told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present work is made up of a series of desultory
sketches of travels, in every quarter of the globe,
and extending through a period of nearly thirty years.
You almost forget yourself as you read, and fancy
that you are listening to an oral narrative from Capt.
Hall in person. In the most charming manner possible
you are transported from the glaciers of the Alps
to the waters of the Pacific, and then whisked back
again to old Europe, and hurried to Vesuvius, Malta,
and Etna in pleasing succession. The descriptions
of these various places, mingled with scientific observations,
and narratives of personal adventures, form
altogether one of the pleasantest books for after-dinner
perusal, especially on a sunny April day, when,
reposed at length upon a sofa, beside an open casement,
with the birds carolling without, and the
balmy spring breathing across us, we forget, for a
while, the dull business of life.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>“Georgia Illustrated.” W. &amp; W. C. Richards,
Penfield, Ga.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a praiseworthy work, and reflects high
credit on all concerned in it. The views are selected
with taste, and give us a high opinion of the scenery
of Georgia. They are accompanied by a letter-press
description, from the pen of the editor, W. C.
Richards. The engravings are executed in excellent
style by Messrs. Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Smillie.
Such works cannot be too extensively patronised.
They encourage the arts; foster a love for the beautiful;
and acquaint the public with some of the loveliest
gems of our native scenery. Was it not a disgrace
to our country that both “Hinton’s Topography” and
the still later “American Scenery,” emanated wholly
from England—the capital embarked, the sketchers
and engravers employed, and even the place of publication
being English?</p>
